# Contributing

Thanks for looking. rigc is small and opinionated, and most of the opinions are
written down — [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) is the doctrine, and it is worth ten minutes
before a first patch.

## Issues are the ledger

Open an issue before a substantial change. Not for ceremony: this project keeps
its open questions in issues rather than in a backlog file, so an issue is where a
decision gets its reasons attached and where the next reader finds them.

A good issue for a defect names three things:

1. what you gave rigc — the rig spec, the motion spec, the manifest if there was
   one, or the smallest edit to a fixture in [`fixtures/`](fixtures/public.ts) that
   reproduces it;
2. what it printed, verbatim, including the assertion name;
3. what you expected instead.

⚠️ **A wrong artifact that validates green is the most valuable report there is.**
The whole tool exists because Spine's parser accepts a great deal of wrongness in
silence, so "rigc said green and the result is broken" is a bug in rigc even when
every assertion behaved as written.

## Before you open a pull request

Three commands, all of them fast, and CI runs the same three:

```bash
bun run typecheck    # bunx tsc --noEmit
bun run lint         # one rule: @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any, as an error
bun run selftest     # the validator's own negative controls
```

`bun run selftest` needs no arguments and no assets — it generates its own
fixtures. A build of a generated fixture or probe lands inside that fixture's
own directory, never in a temp directory beside it: a page name is the art's
path seen from the atlas, so a build from beside it would write a temp
directory's random name into the pair and its document, and the same inputs
would count as a different build in every process that built them (`TY36`
reads every recorded build for that name). If you have not run `bun run fetch-examples`, the suites that read the
corpus will report a hole rather than a result — `TY20` prints them by name, so
the run says which — and a run where nothing substantive executed exits 2 rather
than printing green. That includes the core suite's corpus half: a control there
whose only unmet probe needs a corpus row prints a hole when the corpus is
absent and a FAIL when it is on disk and reaches nothing, and `TY22` holds the
two apart. Fetch the corpus before trusting a green. While iterating
on one suite, `bun selftest.ts --only <suite>[,<suite>…]` runs just those and
exits 2 naming every suite it skipped — it is never a verdict, so run the whole
`bun run selftest` before you open a pull request.

The harness takes exactly these arguments, and `bun selftest.ts --help` prints
them. Any other — an unknown flag, a near miss of a real one, `--jobs=2`, a
stray word, a flag given twice — is refused by name with this list on stderr,
exit 2, before the run sweeps or makes anything, so a typo never turns into a
full run. A near miss names the flag when exactly one is one edit away.

<!-- selftest.ts flagTableText(): TY45 holds this block to `bun selftest.ts --help` -->
```text
  --only <suite>[,<suite>…]        a PARTIAL run of the named suites: exits 2 when green, never a verdict
  --cuts <cuts.json>               adds a suite that compiles and gates every cut in that table (or RIGC_CUTS=<cuts.json>)
  --shard <i>/<n>                  runs the suites dealt to shard i of n: exits 2 when green, never a verdict (or RIGC_SHARD=<i>/<n>)
  --tally-out <file>               with --shard: where the shard writes the tally document --merge reads (or RIGC_TALLY_OUT=<file>)
  --merge <file>…                  every shard's tally document merged: the verdict
  --shards-base [<file>]           with --merge: a green merge writes the durations base, to <file> or over the tracked one
  --memory-base                    a green one-process full run writes its platform's memory base
  --memory-base-children [<file>]  with --merge: a green merge writes the children's half of the memory base
  --reset-children-base            lets a writer of the children's figures move a tracked one, up or down, or replace them read at another --jobs
  --jobs <n>                       how many of a suite's independent units run at once; the machine's cores by default (or RIGC_JOBS=<n>)
  --keep-temp                      keeps this process's temp root and names it on stderr (or RIGC_KEEP_TEMP=1)
  --help                           prints this table on stdout and exits 0, before anything is made or swept
  -h                               the same as --help
  --unit <spec.json> <out.json>    this process is one unit a suite handed out; runs no suite (passed by a run to a process it starts)
```

The whole run can also be cut into shards and merged, which is how CI runs it:
`bun selftest.ts --shard <i>/<n> --tally-out <file>` runs the suites dealt to
shard `i` and writes what it ran, exiting 2 when green like `--only`. The deal
is longest-first over the per-suite seconds in `tools/selftest_shards.base.json`
— each suite, heaviest first, to the shard holding the least so far — and a
suite the base has no entry for is dealt round-robin by its registration index.
`bun selftest.ts --merge <file>…` over every shard's document refuses by name a
set that is not one run's shards each once (including shards that were dealt
two different ways), runs the three suites that read the whole run, and prints
the full run's summary and verdict; add `--shards-base [<file>]` and a green
merge writes the base again from its own seconds (to `<file>`, or over the
tracked base when none is named). CI's merge writes it and uploads it as the
`selftest-shards-base` artifact, which is where the tracked base comes from.
Never edit the base by hand.
`RIGC_SHARD` and `RIGC_TALLY_OUT` name the same two values through the
environment. CI's `shard` jobs are the six shards side by side and its `test`
job is the merge. On a machine you share, run the shards one after another, not
together: each is a whole process with its own memory high-water.

Inside a suite, independent units run concurrently: `render-hashes`' eight
`render_hashes.ts` runs and two batches of its CLI runs, `packer`'s packs by
set, and `core`'s posing-heavy controls, which `--jobs` workers share. `--jobs
<n>` (or `RIGC_JOBS`) is how many run at once; the default is the machine's
cores, and `--jobs 1` runs them one after another as the run did before the
flag. The printed log is the same text at any `--jobs`. On a machine you share,
pass `--jobs 2`.

The run's memory is read in two places. Each suite's line ends with the
process's RSS, its change across the suite, and the heap and external buffers
after a forced collection; a suite that ran units adds `children high-water
<MB> MB (<unit>)` — the largest peak of any child process it started, as the
driver read it, and which unit that was (a `core` worker is named for the unit
it was running when its peak was reached). The `--jobs 1` path reads no child's
peak, so there the line says nothing about children. The unit of a child's
`maxRSS` is read through the call that reads it: each driver first runs one
`bun -e` child that holds 64 MiB and decides bytes or KiB from what
`Bun.spawn`'s `resourceUsage()` reports for it (`TY42` holds a known 256 MiB
child to that reading), and a calibration that reads neither leaves every
peak unread, with the reason in `RIGC_UNIT_PEAKS`. Both figures are held
under `tools/selftest_memory.base.json` (`selftest-memory/2`), one entry per
platform: the parent's high-water (`TY26`, and the full run after its tables)
times `MEMORY_MARGIN`, and one children's figure per suite with the `--jobs`
they were read at (`TY40`), each suite's heaviest child held under its own
figure times `CHILDREN_MARGIN`. A platform with no entry, or no children's
figures, is a `SKIP` naming the command that writes them: `bun selftest.ts
--memory-base` on a green one-process full run at `--jobs 2` or more writes
both halves. Never type them. A shard holds its own figures and the merge
holds every shard's. The children's figures have a second writer, because a
child's peak is its own process's whichever shard started it: `bun selftest.ts
--merge <file>… --memory-base-children [<file>]` writes only the children's
half of its platform's entry — each suite's largest child over the shard
documents and the merge's own suites, at the `--jobs` they ran at, which every
process that measured a child must agree on — and leaves the parent's
high-water, which only a one-process run can read (`--memory-base` under
`--merge` stays refused). CI's merge writes it on every run and uploads it as
the `selftest-memory-base` artifact.

Who writes which figure, and when (issue #1166): **noise never moves a tracked
children's figure.** Both writers keep every tracked figure whatever the run
read, up or down, and their line says so beside the run's — `kept core 587 MB
(this run 650 MB), packer 389 MB (this run 380 MB) … at --jobs 4 — a tracked
figure moves only with --reset-children-base`. So a green run leaves nothing to
commit, and the artifact is committed only when it says something new: a suite
the base holds no figure for is added with the run's reading (`added run-tally
23 MB (the base held no figure for it)`), and until it is committed `TY40` is a
`SKIP` naming that suite. Moving a figure is a deliberate act with one
spelling: add `--reset-children-base` to either writer and the run's figures
replace the tracked ones, up or down (`reset core 726 → 587 MB …`), dropping a
tracked suite the run did not measure. The same spelling is the only way to
replace figures read at another `--jobs`, which is otherwise refused by name,
because a figure is a reading at one `--jobs`. Without either writer the
spelling is refused, since it would write nothing. The figures written against
are always the tracked file's, the ones the ceiling reads, never the file named
after `--memory-base-children`, which is overwritten unread. A run that
measured no child keeps the tracked figures. The parent's high-water is still
written as the one-process run measured it. The linux figures were written from
CI run 37340730277 (main at `f657d83`); darwin's are written by `--memory-base`
on a laptop at `--jobs 2`, and until they are, `TY40` is a `SKIP` there. A
`selftest-memory/1` document — one children's figure per platform — still
reads for its parent half; its children's figure is not read, and `TY40` names
it.

What the ceiling detects: `CHILDREN_MARGIN` is 1.5 because a figure is one
run's reading, and over 48 CI runs on unchanged code `core`'s heaviest child
read 495–728 MB (1.47 between its lowest and highest), `packer`'s 330–420 and
`render-hashes`' 154–183 — so a figure from any one of those runs keeps every
other green, which 1.4 does not (from the lowest it fails 9 of the 48). From
the linux figures as tracked the bounds are `core` 880 MB, `packer` 583,
`render-hashes` 261 and `run-tally` 34: a suite's heaviest child is named once
it grows about 55 % over its median reading (`core` +56 %, `packer` +53 %,
`render-hashes` +57 %). The ratchet these replaced held one figure per
platform, 726 MB × 1.4 = 1,016 MB, which named nothing under +80 % for `core`,
+167 % for `packer` and +510 % for `render-hashes`, and needed a hand commit
whenever a run read above it. The ceiling holds each suite's largest child,
not the sum alive at once, because the sum is a reading of one schedule; the
sum is at most `--jobs` times the largest. To read every
unit's figure, set `RIGC_UNIT_PEAKS=<file>`: one line per unit with its peak,
its seconds and when in its batch it started and ended, which is where the
overlap of a batch's children is read from.

A run leaves `tmpdir()` as it found it. Every directory a selftest process makes
lives under one `rigc-selftest-XXXXXX` root of its own, which the process
removes when it exits, green or red; a shard and a `--jobs` unit are processes
and remove their own (`TY39` counts what a run leaves). `--keep-temp` (or
`RIGC_KEEP_TEMP=1`) keeps the root to read and names it on stderr until a later
run finds it stale, 24 hours after anything was last made or removed directly
inside it; any other spelling is refused by name. A run killed by a signal
leaves its root behind, so every run except a `--unit` child first removes each
`rigc-selftest-XXXXXX` directory directly under `tmpdir()` that nothing has
touched for 24 hours, and says how many and their size on stderr (nothing when
there were none); `TY44` holds what it removes and what it must not. The age
counts from a run's last direct entry, not its start, so the gap it must
outlast is at most a whole run — the longest measured is 23 minutes, and the
longest quiet stretch read inside a 9-minute run was 96 s — and 24 hours
leaves room for a loaded machine or one that slept through part of a run. A symlink or
file of that name, a younger root and every other name are left alone.

There is a fourth. It is fast — the whole battery was 9.4s on the machine it was
written on — but it is out of the list above because it is not offline: it
installs packages, so it needs a network:

```bash
bun run smoke        # pack, install into an empty directory, build a rig from the install
```

CI runs it too, in its own job. Reach for it before pushing anything that touches
`files` in `package.json`, `bin/`, a runtime `import` that crosses a directory,
or the dependency — those are the changes a green checkout cannot see, because
everything the tree runs is on disk and only what `files` names reaches the
registry. It needs `npm`, `bun` and `tar` on PATH and the network for exactly one
package, and its own three planted failures run beside the green case, so a run
that passes has watched the check fail three times first. RELEASING.md's *Whether
the tarball runs* is the argument.

## What a change has to clear

- **No `any`, no `as any`, in `src/` or `cli.ts`.** `selftest.ts` is the one
  exception and it is scoped: its mutants forge malformed skeleton JSON on
  purpose, so the rule is switched off around the mutant tables and back on after.
  The `eslint-disable` comments have to actually bracket every `any` in the file.
- **A new assertion needs a mutant.** A gate nobody has seen fail is not a gate,
  so every assertion needs a case in `selftest.ts` that makes it fire, and every
  suite needs a positive control. An assertion whose data is absent must report
  **SKIP** — never a pass. Folding vacuous checks into the pass count is how a
  gate comes to look kept while checking nothing.
- **No bypass of the round trip.** There must never be a `--no-validate` flag, an
  environment escape, or an exported API that hands back emitted artifacts without
  spine-core having parsed them. That is a structural invariant for one reason,
  correctness, and that reason is sufficient by itself; the licensing one was
  retired on 2026-09-05 (issue #398 — the bullet below records it).
  [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) sets the invariant out, and [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) has
  the licence chain, which is a fact about what the code links and stands
  whether or not the clause does.
- **The compiler never invents a value.** No defaults guessed from the art, no
  re-measuring of plates, no reasonable fallbacks. A missing number is a
  `CompileError` naming the field.
- **Nothing project-specific goes in.** If a comment, a default or an assertion
  can only be understood by someone who has seen one particular set of art, it
  belongs with that art and not here. Budgets and structural invariants come from
  the rig spec's `invariants` block; design notes live with the consumer.
- **Determinism is a contract.** `A18_DETERMINISTIC_EMIT` compares a second,
  independent compile byte for byte. Iteration over an unordered set, a timestamp,
  a locale-sensitive format or floating noise all break it, and that is the point.
- **An input format, an error message or an assertion changed?** Then
  [docs/AUTHORING.md](docs/AUTHORING.md) changed too. That guide and the
  validator's messages are the only interface an agent that cannot see the rig
  actually has.
- **A change that moves a gallery build's bytes on purpose regenerates the base
  in the same pull request.** `tools/emit_hashes.base.json` records, hash by
  hash, the Spine files every `gallery/<name>/` build writes (the skeleton and
  the atlas, which are the same bytes on every machine), and five selftest gates hold
  the tree to it on every run, CI included — so a moved build is red on your
  branch until the file moves with it, and `EH06` names the row, the file and the
  command. That command is `bun tools/emit_hashes.ts base`; run it, commit the
  file, and say in the pull request which rows changed and why
  (`bun tools/emit_hashes.ts base --check` prints them before you regenerate).
  Like every tool that builds recipes into a work directory, it removes the one
  it made under `tmpdir()` when it ends, green or red; `--keep-work` keeps that
  directory to read and names it on stderr, and a directory you name with
  `--work` is yours and is never removed.
  The file is written by that command and never by hand: a copy whose hashes all
  agree but whose bytes do not is refused as stale too
  ([#930](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/930)).

## Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with a scope —
`feat(compile):`, `fix(validate):`, `test(selftest):`, `docs(authoring):`. Subject
and body in English. The subject line is what release-please reads to decide the
next version and what lands in the changelog, so write it for the person reading
`CHANGELOG.md` six months from now: `feat` bumps the minor, `fix`, `perf` and
`check` bump the patch, and everything else is invisible to the release. See
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

⚠️ **A landing that changes a file inside the published package has to be
visible to the release.** The package is the `files` allowlist plus what npm
always adds — `npm pack --dry-run` prints it — and it contains seven guides under
`docs/`, so *a correction to a shipped guide changes what `npm install` hands
somebody*. The `ships` job in CI compares what your branch changed against that
list and refuses a landing the release cannot see. Its verdict is **not** that
your type is wrong: a doc correction really is a `docs` change, and what is
missing is that it also ships. Either remedy clears it — a type the changelog
shows, or a `Release-As:` footer in a **commit message on the branch**, since the
squash body is made of the commits and not of the pull request body. A change
that touches nothing in the package is unaffected whatever its type
([#516](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/516)).

⚠️ **A control that leaves has to be named by the change that removes it.** The
`removals` job in CI reads the control names on your branch against the ones its
merge base carried, and every name that went has to be declared. What counts as
a declaration is derived per run rather than listed: the code's **first
segment** where that segment names one control in the base, and the **whole
name** where it names several — the job prints which, and prints the name it
wants. The remedy is that line: write the code it names **in a commit message on
this branch, or in the pull request title or body**. A rename takes the old name
out of the tree, so it is declared exactly like any other removal.

Keep one unit of work per commit. A body that has to explain two unrelated things
is two commits.

## Things that are decided

Not to shut down discussion, but so nobody spends an afternoon on a patch that was
already weighed:

- **Nothing rigc writes to disk goes unread by a parser rigc did not write.** No
  `--no-validate`, no `--emit-anyway`, no environment escape, no exported API that
  hands back artifacts with the round trip skipped — not for testing either. A
  patch that adds one will be declined whatever it is for; `CLAUDE.md` states the
  invariant and the reason.

  🗓️ This bullet used to read *"rigc is complementary to the Spine editor, not a
  substitute for it … Changes that push it toward being a way around an editor
  licence are out of scope."* Retired 2026-09-05 (issue #398): declaring a
  format-agnostic core with its own format and player (issue #380) makes that a
  promise the roadmap already contradicts, and a decided-questions list is the
  worst place to keep one. What is unchanged is the sentence above it and the
  fact under it — rigc links `spine-core`, so the Spine Runtimes License covers
  running it, which `NOTICE.md` states and this retirement does not touch.
- **`strict: false` with `strictNullChecks: true`** in `tsconfig.json`. Turning on
  the rest is a refactor, not a gate; `tsconfig.json` says so in place. Raise it
  when somebody is prepared to do that work.
- **One lint rule.** The recommended set would arrive with a few hundred findings
  across code nobody is refactoring today, and a lint run that is red on arrival
  teaches everyone to run it with their eyes closed. Add rules when somebody is
  prepared to fix what they find.

## Licence

Contributions are accepted under the MIT licence in [LICENSE](LICENSE). Note that
rigc links `spine-core`, so working on it — like shipping its output — falls under
the Spine Runtimes License and requires a Spine editor licence; [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md)
sets out that chain in full.
