/**
 * rigc's second entry: the commands that reach nothing of spine-core (issue
 * #1052, step 4e of #380).
 *
 *   bun cli_core.ts render --candidate <dir> [flags]
 *   bun cli_core.ts check --candidate <dir> --frames <dir> [flags]
 *   bun cli_core.ts --help                 the commands this entry runs
 *
 * Which commands those are is not listed here: it is every command whose
 * `runtime` is `false` in the one command table (`src/cli/shared.ts`), and
 * `--help` prints exactly that set. This file imports nothing that links the
 * runtime — no module it reaches, statically, imports
 * `@esotericsoftware/spine-core` — so it runs with the package absent
 * (`RC24`/`RC25` in `selftest.ts` build that state and hold it). Each command
 * prints and writes what `cli.ts` prints and writes for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ What it cannot do, and refuses by name rather than reaching for: an input
 * only the runtime reads — a Spine export, `--poser spine`, a fallback the
 * poser line names, the deform survey of a build the core refuses — and a
 * command whose body is the runtime's (`validate`, `bench`, `bonedist`,
 * `preview`, `vote`). Both say what they needed spine-core for and that this
 * entry links none of it; `cli.ts` runs them.
 *
 * `build` is the one name with a body here of its own (issue #1060,
 * `CORE_ENTRY_RUNS`): `cli.ts build`'s body (`runBuild`), writing the same
 * files, with another gate — the model side over the document and the round
 * trip's own rules restated over the emitted text, A00 (spine-core's parse) a
 * SKIP naming it. `--help` and `build --help` say so; the command table states
 * it (`runtime.core` in `src/cli/shared.ts`).
