# walk — IK constraints, and an IK timeline that lets a leg go

Rigby walks on the spot. Two legs, each a two-bone chain with an **IK constraint**
solving it to a foot target, and an **IK timeline** that holds the planted leg to
the ground and releases the swinging one at the top of its lift.

⭐ **The one feature this example stars: `ik`.** The constraint
([AUTHORING §3.5](../../docs/AUTHORING.md)) and the timeline that keys it
([§4.9](../../docs/AUTHORING.md)). Everything else here — the hip bob, the
follow-through on the ears and the scarf, the arm swing — is the ordinary
key-pose-and-in-between recipe of [MOTION.md](../../docs/MOTION.md), and it is
present because a leg chain on its own is not a walk.

```
bun install                                   # once

bun cli.ts build   --rig gallery/walk/rig.json \
                   --motion gallery/walk/motion.json \
                   --out gallery/walk/build
bun cli.ts render  --candidate gallery/walk/build --fps 20 --max 288 \
                   --out gallery/walk/render
bun cli.ts preview --candidate gallery/walk/build --out gallery/walk/preview.html

# does the cycle close on the pose it opened with?
bun gallery/loop_seam.ts gallery/walk/render/walk@20fps

# re-draw the 15 part PNGs. Needs rsvg-convert; the PNGs are committed, so this
# is for changing the art or checking that the committed bytes are the ones the
# script draws.
bun gallery/walk/make_parts.ts
```

`build`, `render` and `preview` write into this directory and are **not
committed** — the specs and the part PNGs are, and those three commands
regenerate the rest. Look at `gallery/walk/render/walk@20fps/contact.png`: it is
the whole cycle on one sheet, which is the only place a loop is a thing you can
see.

## The rig

15 region attachments, 21 bones, 2 IK constraints. Three parts of it are
decisions rather than transcription:

### The leg is two plates, and the seam is the knee

A one-piece leg cannot bend. `thigh` and `shin` are separate parts, each drawn
**from its own joint**, and each bone's local **+x runs down the limb** —
`thigh_*` at `rotation: -90`, `shin_*` at the thigh's own `x: 56` with no
rotation of its own. That axis is not a style: `IkConstraint.apply2` measures the
chain as `l1 = child.x` and `l2 = child.length`, and solves so that the point
`l2` along the child's **+x** reaches the target. A chain whose bones point some
other way solves correctly and draws nowhere near the target.

The plates then need `"rotation": 90` to cancel the bone, because they are drawn
upright, and an `x` offset to slide their centre down the bone — 28 for the
thigh, 31 for the shin, which is each plate's own centre measured from its joint.

```
    hip ─┬─ thigh_f  (rotation -90, length 56)  ─── shin_f  (x 56, length 74)
         └─ thigh_b  (rotation -90, length 56)  ─── shin_b  (x 56, length 74)

    root ── ground ─┬─ foot_f   ← the IK targets
                    └─ foot_b
```

### The foot targets hang off `ground`, not off `hip`

This is the whole reason the example has an IK chain in it. In a walk the hip
**bobs** and the planted foot **does not**, so the target has to be somewhere the
hip's own motion cannot reach it. `ground` is a child of `root` at the contact
line; `foot_f` and `foot_b` are children of `ground`. Parent a foot target to
`hip` and the hip carries its own feet up with it, the solver reports success, and
the figure hovers.

Measured on this build, over the stance where `foot_f` is planted:

| t | `hip` world | `foot_f` world |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.000 | 352.0, 190.0 | 382.0, 68.0 |
| 0.150 | 354.7, 197.1 | 382.0, 68.0 |
| 0.200 | 354.9, 197.9 | 382.0, 68.0 |
| 0.300 | 353.7, 194.5 | 382.0, 68.0 |
| 0.450 | 352.0, 190.0 | 382.0, 68.0 |

The hip travels 7.9 units up and 2.9 sideways; the foot does not move at all, to
the decimal. That is the IK earning its place, and it is the number to reproduce
if you change the leg.

### `bendPositive` is **opposite** on the two legs

The two chains are *translated* copies, not mirrored ones — both thighs point
down, both plates are the same drawing. So one `bendPositive` value bends both
knees the same way round, which reads as one leg being on backwards. Opposite
values give a symmetric pair:

| | `bendPositive` | thigh at x | knee (`shin`) at x | knee sits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `leg_f_ik` | `false` | 382 | 397.8 | 15.8 outward |
| `leg_b_ik` | `true` | 322 | 306.2 | 15.8 outward |

Both bulge away from the body. `true`/`false` swapped gives a knock-kneed pair at
the same 15.8; the arithmetic is `56 · sin(16.4°)`, where 16.4° is the hip angle
the law of cosines gives for `l1 = 56`, `l2 = 74` and a target 126 away.

🚨 **And the value has to be stated on every key of the IK timeline as well as on
the constraint** — see *What this cost*, below. That is not an idiom, it is a
runtime hole ([issue #273](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/273)).

## The motion

`walk`, 0.9 s, two steps, loops. The plan, and why each piece is the size it is:

| Track | Keys | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `foot_f` / `foot_b` `translate` | 6 | the step. Two equal keys for the stance **hold**, then three through the flight |
| `hip` `translate` | 5 | the bob: twice per cycle, peaking over the planted foot, with 3 units of weight shift toward it |
| `chest` `rotate` | 4 | the body's sway, one cycle, **+10%** after the hip |
| `head` `rotate` | 4 | the head holding level against the chest, **+20%** |
| `ears` `rotate` (a group) | 5 | the bounce, twice per cycle, **+25%**, biggest amplitude of anything here |
| `tail` `rotate` | 4 | the scarf, one cycle, **+30%** |
| `arm_f` / `arm_b` `rotate` | 4 | the arm swing, in antiphase with each other |
| `hand_f` `rotate` | 3 | the wrist, **+15%** after its arm |
| `ik` × 2 | 5 each | ⭐ the star — below |

Those percentages are [MOTION.md §3.7](../../docs/MOTION.md)'s offset table, as
fractions of the duration, and they are the cheapest thing on this page: same
poses, same easings, same key count, and the figure stops reading as one rigid
piece.

Four named easings, per [§3.4](../../docs/MOTION.md) — one that leaves an extreme
slowly (`gather`), one that leaves fast and arrives slowly (`charge`), and two
symmetric (`settle`, `breathe`). Nothing here is linear; a missing `ease` would be
a positive claim of constant speed.

### The flight arc needs interior keys, and the stance needs two

Both are [§3.5](../../docs/MOTION.md) and [§3.3](../../docs/MOTION.md) doing
geometric work rather than shaping timing:

- A `translate` track draws the **straight line** between two keys. The foot's
  path through the air is an arc, so the three interior keys at 25 / 50 / 75 % of
  the flight are what the arc is made of — remove them and the foot travels in a
  V.
- The stance is a **hold**, and a hold is authored: `foot_f` carries the same
  `[0, 0]` at `t: 0` and at `t: 0.45`. One key would slope a line through the
  whole stance and the planted foot would drift.

### ⭐ The IK timeline

```json
"ik": [
  { "constraint": "leg_f_ik", "keys": [
      { "t": 0,     "mix": 1,    "softness": 0,  "bendPositive": false, "ease": "settle" },
      { "t": 0.225, "mix": 1,    "softness": 12, "bendPositive": false, "ease": "settle" },
      { "t": 0.45,  "mix": 1,    "softness": 0,  "bendPositive": false, "ease": "gather" },
      { "t": 0.675, "mix": 0.55, "softness": 0,  "bendPositive": false, "ease": "charge" },
      { "t": 0.9,   "mix": 1,    "softness": 0,  "bendPositive": false } ] },
  …
]
```

Three things are being said, and `leg_b_ik` says the same three half a cycle later:

- **`mix: 1` through the stance** (0 → 0.45): the foot is nailed to the contact
  line and the hip moves against it. This is the table above.
- **`softness: 12` at mid-stance** (0.225): mid-stance is where the leg is
  nearest full extension, and a two-bone chain at full reach locks and pops.
  Softness backs the target off as the chain straightens, so the knee runs out of
  bend smoothly instead of snapping.
- **`mix: 0.55` at the top of the lift** (0.675): the leg is *let go*. With the
  mix down, the pose blends back toward the bones' own setup — a straight leg —
  so the swing reads as a loose pendulum rather than a foot being dragged along a
  path. `mix` returns to 1 at 0.9, which is the plant.

Every field is stated on **every** key. That is [§4.9](../../docs/AUTHORING.md)'s
rule and it is not a formality: the parser reads each field fresh per key with its
own default, so a key that omits `softness` does not hold the previous key's 12 —
it asserts 0 and interpolates down to it.

## What was verified

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `rigc build --profile spine` | green — **18 assertions ran, 7 skipped**, `A34_CONSTRAINT_TIMELINE_TARGETS` among the 18 |
| `rigc build --profile spine-html` | green as well — 25 ran, 12 skipped. Nothing here needs the default profile to pass |
| `rigc render` | 19 frames at 20 fps, contact sheet **looked at** twice — the first pass caught a 56-unit foot lift that splayed the knees, and a far arm swung out far enough to read as a plank |
| loop seam | **0 / 255** max channel difference, 0 pixels differing of 66 240, at both 20 fps (19 frames, 230×288) and 30 fps (28 frames). The last frame is the first frame to the byte |
| the bone series | `t = 0.900` is identical to `t = 0.000` on every bone, so the seam is closed in the pose and not only in the pixels |
| `rigc preview` | boots in the official Spine Web Player 4.3 and draws (headless chromium, no console or page errors) |
| `bun run selftest` | includes `GALLERY_EXAMPLE_IS_GREEN[walk]` |
| part determinism | `make_parts.ts` twice ⇒ identical bytes for all 15 PNGs |
| `bun run typecheck` / `lint` | green |

## What this cost — the authoring notes

**An `ik` timeline silently reverted the rig's `bendPositive`, and it took a
measurement to see it.**
[Issue #273](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/273). Four builds differing
only in the rig's two `bendPositive` values produced **one pose** — `shin_f`
world x = 366.2 in all four. `SkeletonJson` reads the bend direction per
*timeline key* as well as per constraint, with the same default of `true`, so any
IK timeline that does not restate it overwrites the constraint's value for the
whole animation. The gate is green either way; `bendPositive` in the rig is simply
inert. The workaround is in `motion.json` above — state it on every key — and the
issue proposes a compile error, because a declared value nothing can reach is the
same defect `A36`/`A37` already refuse for a muted constraint.

**A cyclic track cannot be lagged with `stagger` or `lag`.** [MOTION.md
§3.7](../../docs/MOTION.md)'s follow-through is a timing offset, and the motion
spec has two fields for exactly that — except both shift keys *later*, which
pushes a loop's last key past `duration` and is a compile error. So an offset
cyclic track is authored as a **phase-shifted wave**: its extremes move, its `t:
0` and `t: duration` keys carry the same (nonzero) interpolated value, and the
final segment is short. `chest`, `head` and `tail` all look like that, and the
short last segment is the offset, not a mistake.

**The knee direction is invisible on a contact sheet and obvious in a number.**
Two of the four `bendPositive` combinations were indistinguishable at 4× zoom on
the frame where the difference is largest. `shin_f.worldX` separated them
immediately. Look at frames for *whether it reads*; read bone positions for
*what it is doing*.

**A foot lift is bounded by the leg, not by taste.** The first candidate lifted
the foot 56 units on a 130-unit leg: the chain has to fold to a 70-unit span, and
a two-bone solve does that by throwing the knee sideways. 28 units — a fifth of
the leg — is the version that reads as a step.
