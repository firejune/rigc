/**
 * Render a rung's OFFICIAL export to PNG frames — the reference an authoring
 * agent is allowed to look at.
 *
 * ⭐ Why this exists. `docs/LADDER.md`'s honesty rule keeps the reference
 * `skeleton.json` away from the authoring agent, because an agent that has seen
 * the answer is being measured on transcription rather than on authoring. But a
 * human animator would be shown the shot, so withholding *what it looks like*
 * measures nothing except whether the agent can guess. Frames are the honest
 * middle: they are exactly what a client watching the animation could see, and
 * they carry no bone name, no key time and no curve handle.
 *
 * ⚠️ The frames must come from the **official export**, never from a
 * transcription or from a candidate — that is the whole point of a reference —
 * so this reads `examples/<rung>/export/` and nothing else.
 *
 * ## One example renders local-only, and the rest keep the refusal
 *
 * A rendered frame carries the example's own pixels, so writing one redistributes
 * the images — which every example's `license.txt` grants only while that file
 * travels alongside. `7-anticipation` has no `license.txt` upstream at all, and
 * this script used to refuse it outright and for every output path. That refusal
 * left rung 7 with no obtainable frames, and so — under the honesty rule, where a
 * brief is written by somebody *watching the frames* — with no writable brief
 * either. The owner ruled on 2026-08-26 (issue #3, raised by the
 * brief-verification pass on issue #14) that #3's rule, *"never vendor, commit,
 * publish or ship"*, does not forbid a render that never leaves the local disk.
 *
 * So that one example may be rendered, **only** to a path this repository ignores
 * or does not contain, and every other case keeps the unconditional refusal
 * exactly as it was. See `LOCAL_ONLY_EXAMPLES` below for what holds the exception
 * narrow.
 *
 * ## Why not spine-html, and why no browser at all
 *
 * The obvious route is the sibling `spine-html` renderer under Playwright. It
 * would work, and it costs a vite build, a preview server and one browser
 * screenshot per frame. Nothing here needs a browser: `spine-core` computes the
 * world vertices on the CPU — for a region and, since #27, for a weighted or
 * deformed mesh — and `tools/plate.ts` already reads and writes PNGs. The
 * rasteriser itself lives in [`src/render.ts`](../src/render.ts), which `rigc
 * check` shares — a candidate has to be drawn by the same code that drew the
 * reference or every number `check` reports carries the difference between two
 * renderers on top of the difference between two rigs.
 *
 * Region **and** mesh attachments; a mesh's triangles are filled with
 * barycentric UV interpolation and no perspective divide, which is what a flat
 * 2D deformation is. An attachment type that draws nothing — a bounding box, a
 * point, a clipping shape — is skipped rather than refused.
 *
 * ```
 * bun bench/render_reference.ts --rung 3 [--fps 12] [--max 256] [--tile 128]
 *                                        [--stride 1] [--out <dir>]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Where the frames land
 *
 * ```
 * <out>/[<skeleton label>/]frames.json
 * <out>/[<skeleton label>/]<animation>[@<fps>fps]/f0000.png…, contact.png
 * ```
 *
 * The two optional segments are there only when they carry information, so that
 * the common case stays the short path it already is:
 *
 * - the **label** segment appears when the rung has more than one skeleton (rungs
 *   1 and 8 do). Two skeletons of one rung are two different shots that happen to
 *   share an atlas, and they get their own viewports — pooling their frames in one
 *   directory would say they were comparable;
 * - the **rate** suffix appears at any rate other than the 12 fps protocol, so a
 *   second pass at another rate sits beside the first instead of replacing it.
 *
 * `--stride N` writes every Nth sampled frame while keeping its true index in the
 * name, and the contact sheet still shows **every** sampled frame. That splits two
 * costs a long shot conflates: the frames are what you measure and they are dear
 * (a still of a busy scene is tens of kilobytes, and most of those bytes are the
 * static set redrawn), while the sheet is what you flip through and it is cheap
 * (one file, so deflate finds the redrawn set again in the next tile).
 *
 * ## `frames.json` — the sidecar
 *
 * ⭐ A frame set is a picture of a world box, and until this file was written the
 * box was nowhere: an author could measure a distance in pixels and had no way to
 * turn it into the units a rig is authored in except by finding something of a
 * known size in the shot. Worse, `rigc check` cannot render a candidate *into the
 * same frame* without it, and re-deriving the framing from the candidate would
 * frame the candidate to its own extent — which is precisely the error the
 * reference renderer avoids by measuring the box once, densely, per skeleton.
 *
 * So each skeleton root carries one `frames.json`: the world box, the scale, the
 * background colour, and one entry per frame directory with its rate and count.
 * It is written **beside** the frames rather than inside each directory because
 * the box is a property of the shot and every rate of one skeleton shares it.
 * Sidecars accumulate across runs at different rates; a run whose framing differs
 * from the one on disk replaces the file outright and says which sets it dropped,
 * because those sets are at a scale this file can no longer describe.

 * 🔓 The examples that may be rendered **local-only** — one name, and it is a set
 * rather than a flag on purpose.
 *
 * ⚖️ Ruled by the owner on **2026-08-26**, on
 * [issue #3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/3) (*"Rung 7
 * (`7-anticipation`) has no upstream license.txt — local-only, never
 * redistribute"*), after the brief-verification pass on
 * [issue #14](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/14) found that this
 * script's refusal, not the licence, was what made rung 7 unattemptable: with no
 * frames obtainable there is no honest input for either the writing pass or the
 * verifying pass, and a brief written from `sack-pro.json` would be a
 * transcription of the answer. The ruling: #3's rule — *"never vendor, commit,
 * publish or ship"* — does not forbid a render that stays on this disk, so the
 * refusal takes a deliberate, narrow exception for this one example.
 *
 * Three things keep it narrow, and each is **checked** rather than documented:
 *
 * 1. the exception is this set — one example, edited on a ruling — and not a
 *    `--force`, `--yes-i-know` or `--local-only` flag somebody can pass by
 *    accident or in a copied command line;
 * 2. the output path must be one `git check-ignore` accepts, or lie outside the
 *    repository altogether. So the default lands in `bench/reference-local/`
 *    (which `.gitignore` covers) and `--out bench/reference/7-anticipation`
 *    **refuses** — a frame of this example cannot reach a commit by mistake,
 *    which is the part of #3's rule that has teeth;
 * 3. the guard **fails closed**. No `git`, a broken `git`, or a checkout that is
 *    not a repository refuses too, because *"I could not check"* is not *"it is
 *    ignored"*.
 *
 * 🚫 What the ruling does **not** grant: committing, publishing or shipping these
 * frames, in any artefact, ever. The notice written beside them says so, in the
 * place the missing `license.txt` would have occupied.
