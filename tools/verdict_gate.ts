/**
 * verdict_gate — the validator's two suppliers held to the same lines over a
 * corpus (issue #1025, step 4c of #380): every recipe built through the CLI,
 * its Spine pair gated by `validate()` over what spine-core loaded and its
 * model document gated by the model side (`src/assertions/model/index.ts`)
 * over the document and rigc's core, and every moved assertion's lines
 * compared, under both profiles.
 *
 *   bun tools/verdict_gate.ts [--recipes <recipes.json>] [--root <dir>] [--work <dir>]
 *
 * With no `--recipes`, the tree's own: `tools/emit_hashes.ts`'s `treeRecipes`
 * (every fetched editor export and every gallery rig — nineteen when
 * `examples/` is fetched), built exactly as `emit_hashes run` and
 * `core_gate` build them (`buildRecipes`). `--recipes` takes an
 * `emit-hashes-recipes/1` or `emit-hashes/1` document and `--root` resolves its
 * stages, which is how a private corpus is run: its recipes live with it and
 * only the printed lines leave it.
 *
 * ## Per row
 *
 * The build's `skeleton.json`, `skeleton.atlas` and `skeleton.model.json`,
 * read from `{{out}}`. `validate()` runs over the pair with `atlasDir` the
 * output directory and the rig info the document's own `rig` section states
 * (`documentRig`) and the declared durations it states (`documentDurations`,
 * since cut 4c-3: A09 reads them) — and the model side over the document with
 * the same directory, rig info and durations, under `spine` and again under
 * `spine-html` (A11 is a
 * renderer rule, and `spine` never runs it; the archetype rules A21 and A28
 * likewise). For each moved assertion and
 * profile the row prints `IDENTICAL` or `DIFFERING` with both sides' lines.
 *
 * Beside the lines, the one fact a line cannot show: **the order** the skins'
 * entries are walked in (the region attachments' names and sizes and the
 * clipping count), read off both suppliers (`runtimeFacts`, `modelSkinEntries`)
 * and compared whole — an A03 that fails twice prints its two lines in that
 * order, and a rig no line fails on still has one. And since cut 4c-1, every
 * fact family that cut added, read off both suppliers and spelled whole
 * (`factSpellings`) — the meshes, the bones an animation keys, the skin
 * members, the region joins, the atlas's pages and regions, the stage and the
 * region paths — so a value no line printed on this row is still compared.
 * Cut 4c-4 added its three (the skeleton's bones and slots, every
 * animation's bone timelines, every event key) and the slot timelines A12
 * reads beside A45 to the same set.
 *
 * ## What the model side is given
 *
 * The stage and each page's `pma`: a `rigc-compiled/3` document states both
 * (issue #1026) and is given neither (`modelGivenOf`); for a `/2` or `/1`
 * document, which does not hold them (`src/assertions/model/given.ts`), they
 * are read off the build this row gates by `modelGivenOfBuild`: the stage the
 * skeleton header states and each page's `pma` as `parseAtlasText` reads the
 * atlas. The selftest's supplier check gives them the same way. The rig info is
 * the document's own `rig` section (`documentRig`), given to both sides alike
 * (cut 4c-2).
 *
 * Since cut 4c-2, beside the walk: the four families that cut added, compared
 * fact by fact, and every derivation the model side makes counted against the
 * runtime's value (`tools/rig_facts.ts`) — printed as one `cut 4c-2's facts`
 * line per row and one `DERIVED` line per derivation before the verdict.
 *
 * Since cut 4c-3, the four families the posed assertions read (A39's survey,
 * A09's durations, A43's tint, A46's series), compared question by question
 * (`comparePosedFacts`): each body runs over spine-core's facts, every call it
 * makes is asked of the model side's supplier with the same arguments, and the
 * answers are compared at tolerance 0 — the times A43 and A46 pose at are
 * times no grid or raw frame lands on, so no other gate holds those readings.
 * One `cut 4c-3's facts` line per row, a `REFUSED` line per question the core
 * refused by name, and one `POSED` line per family before the verdict.
 *
 * A row whose build chain exited non-zero, or that wrote no model document, or
 * whose parse both sides refused, is `REFUSED` with the reason, and compares
 * nothing. A row one side reads and the other refuses is `DIFFERING` on "the
 * parse": that is the one disagreement the region rule exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## The verdict
 *
 * The last line counts what was compared, off the rows. Exit codes as
 * `emit_hashes compare`: 0 when every line set and every walk compared is
 * identical, 1 when any differs, 2 when the input is bad by name — or when the
 * run compared nothing at all, which is no verdict.

/**
 * Cut 4c-3's facts over one build (issue #1025), compared value by value: each
 * body runs over spine-core's facts as `validate()` hands them, with every
 * call it makes recorded — a survey, a posed tint, a posed frame, a loaded
 * dark colour, an animation or slot asked for — and the model side's supplier
 * is asked the same question with the same arguments; every value a body
 * reads whole (the durations, the stated darks, the slot and sequence
 * timelines, the skin entries) is compared whole. Answers are spelled exactly
 * (`spellExact`), so two numbers one ulp apart differ. A model-side answer the
 * core refuses by name (`CoreInputError`) is counted as refused with its
 * sentence, never as an answer. `supply` plants a model supplier (`VF12`).
 *
 * ⚠️ The questions are the ones spine-core's facts made the bodies ask — the
 * times A43 and A46 pose at, the exemptions A39 surveys with — because those
 * are the readings no gate samples: a time on a track the oracle's grid and
 * the raw entry's frames do not land on.
