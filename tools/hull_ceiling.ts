/**
 * hull_ceiling — how much page area polygon packing could buy over a corpus,
 * measured before any packer is written (issue #1093).
 *
 *   bun tools/hull_ceiling.ts [--recipes <recipes.json>] [--root <dir>] [--work <dir>] [--json <out.json>]
 *
 * With no `--recipes`, the tree's own: `tools/emit_hashes.ts`'s `treeRecipes`
 * (every fetched editor export and every gallery rig — nineteen when
 * `examples/` is fetched), built exactly as `emit_hashes run` builds them
 * (`buildRecipes`). `--recipes` takes an `emit-hashes-recipes/1` or
 * `emit-hashes/1` document and `--root` resolves its stages, the way
 * `verdict_gate` takes them: a private corpus keeps its recipes with it and
 * only the table leaves it, which names recipes and nothing else.
 *
 * It changes nothing under `src/` and runs no packer of its own. It reads what
 * a build wrote — `skeleton.json`, `skeleton.atlas` and the pages the atlas
 * names — with rigc's own atlas reader (`parseAtlasText`) and rigc's own
 * contour tracer (`traceAlphaOutline`, the one the contour mesher runs).
 *
 * ## The unit: a packed region, in page texels
 *
 * Packing places regions, not attachments, so every figure is summed over the
 * atlas regions some attachment samples, each region once. The region an
 * attachment samples is its `path`, else its stated `name`, else its key —
 * the runtime's rule (`runtimeRegion`; `diff`'s `attachments.refs` reads the
 * same), and the per-region JSON says which of the three reached it — two region
 * attachments that share one image share one rectangle on the page. A region
 * is **mesh-kind** when every attachment that samples it is a mesh or a linked
 * mesh, and **region-kind** when any of them is a region attachment, because a
 * region attachment draws its whole quad and a neighbour's pixels inside it
 * would show. Every area is in the page's own texels, whatever `scale:` the
 * page states.
 *
 * - **rectangle** — the region's `bounds:` width × height. A region at
 *   `rotate: 90`/`270` covers `height x width` of the page (`pageFootprint`);
 *   its area is the same, and the table counts how many are turned.
 * - **mesh hull** — the polygon of a mesh's first `hull` vertices, read as
 *   given (closed from the last vertex back to the first, never re-ordered),
 *   in UV space scaled to the drawing: `u × originalWidth`, `v ×
 *   originalHeight`, which is how a mesh's UVs address a region whose
 *   whitespace the packer stripped. The polygon is then clipped to the kept
 *   rectangle (the part of the drawing that is on the page), and its area is
 *   the shoelace area of what remains. A linked mesh — a `mesh` or
 *   `linkedmesh` with a `source` — takes the hull of the attachment keyed
 *   `source` in the slot `slot` names (its own by default) of the skin `skin`
 *   names (the default skin by default), and samples its own region; a source
 *   that is not there refuses the row by name. A hull whose pruned polygon crosses or touches itself
 *   (`findSelfIntersection`) has no area to state: the region is counted as its
 *   rectangle and the row says how many. Several meshes sampling one region
 *   with hulls that are not the same polygon likewise count the rectangle, and
 *   are counted — the area to protect is their union, which this does not
 *   compute.
 * - **traced contour** — what a region-kind region would protect if it were
 *   converted to a mesh: the corner-lattice outline of its art, at threshold 1
 *   (every texel with alpha > 0 is art, the same threshold as the floor),
 *   UNSIMPLIFIED and with no margin — tolerance 0. That is the tightest polygon
 *   rigc's tracer states, so the row is a ceiling: a contour mesh an author
 *   builds simplifies and pushes out from it. On that lattice an outline
 *   encloses whole texels, so its area is a count: the texels of the art plus
 *   every transparent texel the art encloses (the tracer fills holes, 4-connected
 *   from the footprint's border). The row counts that over EVERY island of the
 *   art (`silhouetteOf`), because a packer must protect strays too.
 *
 *   ⚠️ `traceAlphaOutline` itself traces one island and refuses a diagonal
 *   pinch, and the mesher refuses art whose largest island is under
 *   `CONTOUR_MIN_COVERAGE` of it — 18 of this corpus's 240 region-kind regions
 *   are refused one way or the other. Counting those as their rectangle put the
 *   traced row ABOVE the convex one on six recipes, which no polygon inside a
 *   convex hull can be. So the tracer is not the row's arithmetic; it is the
 *   row's witness: on every region it traces as ONE island, its outline's
 *   shoelace area must equal `silhouetteOf`'s count to the texel, and a region
 *   where they differ refuses the row by name (`checked` in the JSON says on
 *   how many regions the two agreed).
 * - **opaque texels** — texels in the rectangle with alpha > 0, and beside
 *   them the **floor**: the opaque texels that are DRAWN — inside the hull
 *   (texel centre in the polygon) for a mesh-kind region, all of them for a
 *   region-kind one. They differ because an authored hull may leave art out:
 *   the texels outside it are never sampled, so on such rigs the raw count
 *   exceeds the hull and is no floor at all. A region with a rectangle and not
 *   one texel of alpha > 0 is legal (an empty part) and is not refused, but it
 *   is named in the row's notes by page, and so is a page with no such texel
 *   anywhere — a total of 0 never stands silently for a page that did not read.
 *
 * Turned regions are read in the drawing's orientation through `regionWindow`,
 * the index map `extractRegion` applies (HUL06 holds them equal at every
 * turn); every count is invariant under the turn. `--json` carries, per row,
 * every page (name, size, its texels of alpha > 0) and every region (name,
 * page, rotate, kind, how its name was reached, rectangle, hull, silhouette,
 * traced, convex, opaque, drawn opaque).
 *
 * Per recipe the row states Σ rectangle; Σ hull with meshes only (region-kind
 * regions counted as their rectangle); Σ hull with regions converted, once by
 * trace and once by convex hull (mesh-kind regions keep their mesh hull); Σ
 * drawn opaque (the floor) and Σ opaque; each hull and the floor over Σ
 * rectangle; and **covered** — Σ rectangle of every region
 * on the pages over the pages' area, the figure `build --pack` prints. A
 * recipe whose atlas rigc wrote one part per page is built a second time with
 * `--pack --page-edges free` (into `{{work}}/packed`) and covered is read off
 * that atlas; a recipe built `--atlas-in` reads covered off the pack it was
 * given, whose packer (the editor, for the fetched exports) is named in the
 * row, because its whitespace strip and its rotation are in its rectangles and
 * not in rigc's.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 every recipe measured; 1 a recipe refused or unreadable (named
 * in the table and on stderr); 2 a bad input by name. The wall time is printed
 * on stderr and nowhere else, so two runs print the same table.
