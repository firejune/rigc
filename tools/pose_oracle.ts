 *
 * ⭐ Why this is a document and not a function. The equivalence gate issue
 * #380 stands on (`P_ours(M) ≡ P_spine(B)`) compares the pose spine-core gives
 * a Spine file against the pose a SECOND implementation gives the same rig. The
 * second implementation does not link spine-core — that is the whole point of
 * it — so the contract between the two cannot be a TypeScript type or a call
 * into this file. It is the JSON below. Everything a second dumper needs to
 * write the same document is stated in this header: every field, in the order
 * it is written, and which spine-core 4.3.13 call produced it here, so that
 * the call's semantics can be reproduced rather than imported. If a sentence
 * below is not enough to reproduce a field, that is a defect in this header.
 *
 * The prototype this was promoted from graded rigc's builds against the
 * editor's exports on the 1.0 exam and read IDENTICAL on 14 of 14 production
 * rigs. What was added to it is what its own notes listed as not yet dumped:
 * world vertices (with deform and weights), the draw order, clipping, events,
 * stepped physics and posing under one skin.
 *
 * ## `dump` — the document, `"spec": "pose-oracle/4"`
 *
 * 🔢 **The number in `spec` changes whenever a field is added, removed or
 * moved.** `compare` reads a row by position and a reader refuses any `spec`
 * but its own, so a document with a cell the reader does not know is refused
 * by name rather than compared on the cells the reader does know — which
 * would read IDENTICAL over a difference it never looked at. `/1` became `/2`
 * when the slot row gained its blend mode (issue #933), `/2` became `/3`
 * when a pose gained its `clipped` block (issue #964), and `/3` became `/4`
 * when it gained its `uvs` block (issue #967).
 *
 * One JSON object on one line, then a newline. Key order is fixed and is the
 * order written here. Two dumps of one input are byte-identical: no clock, no
 * randomness, no unordered iteration (every list is in the skeleton's own
 * order, stated per field).
 *
 * 🔢 **Every number is rounded** by `r(v) = floor(v * 1e6 + 0.5) / 1e6`
 * (JavaScript's `Math.round(v * 1e6) / 1e6` — round half UP, not half to even),
 * and written as the shortest decimal that reads back to that double. A value
 * that is not finite is written `null`. The one number not rounded is
 * `options.dt`, because it defines the stepping schedule and a rounded 1/60
 * would step a different one.
 *
 * Top level, in order:
 *
 * - `spec` — the string `"pose-oracle/4"`.
 * - `dumper` — who posed it, free text (`"spine-core 4.3.13"` here). Never
 *   compared.
 * - `source` — `{ "spine": <string|null>, "hash": <string|null> }`, the
 *   skeleton file's own `skeleton.spine` and `skeleton.hash`
 *   (`SkeletonData.version`/`.hash`). Never compared: a rebuild states the
 *   runtime it links and an export the editor that wrote it.
 * - `options` — `{ "phase", "samples", "skin", "physics", "dt" }`, the flags
 *   the dump was taken under; `dt` is `null` unless `physics` is `"step"`.
 *   Two dumps taken under different options are not comparable and `compare`
 *   refuses the pair (exit 2).
 * - `absent` — written only by a dumper that leaves a block out (the core,
 *   below): `[[block, why], …]` naming every block that is `null` in this
 *   document, in document order, with the construct not yet admitted. A block
 *   is one of `bones`, `slots`, `skins`, `constraints`, `physics`, `paths`,
 *   `pathAttachments`, `setup.bones`, `setup.slots`, `setup.drawOrder`,
 *   `setup.attachments`, `setup.clips`, `setup.clipped`, `setup.uvs`,
 *   `animations`, and the eight a sample carries — `animations.bones`,
 *   `animations.slots`, `animations.drawOrder`, `animations.attachments`,
 *   `animations.clips`, `animations.clipped`, `animations.uvs`,
 *   `animations.events`
 *   (`ORACLE_BLOCKS`). A sample block left out is `null` in EVERY sample and
 *   named once; one not named is a list in every sample; with `animations`
 *   itself `null` the sample blocks are nobody's and are not named. A `null`
 *   block the list does not name, a name that is not a `null` block, or a
 *   sample block `null` in some samples and not others makes the document
 *   unreadable (exit 2). The spine-core dump leaves nothing out and writes no
 *   `absent` key.
 * - `bones` — every bone name in skeleton order (`SkeletonData.bones`, which is
 *   parent-before-child).
 * - `slots` — `[name, bone]` per slot in setup order (`SkeletonData.slots`,
 *   `SlotData.boneData.name`). The bone is here so a comparison can carry the
 *   ill-conditioned rule from a bone to the geometry its slots draw.
 * - `skins` — every skin name in file order (`SkeletonData.skins`).
 * - `constraints` — `[[type, name], …]` in `SkeletonData.constraints` order,
 *   which is the order the runtime updates them in; `type` is one of `ik`,
 *   `transform`, `path`, `physics`, `slider`.
 * - `physics` — one object per physics constraint, constraint order:
 *   `name, bone, x, y, rotate, scaleX, shearX, limit, step, inertia, strength,
 *   damping, massInverse, wind, gravity, mix, inertiaGlobal, strengthGlobal,
 *   dampingGlobal, massGlobal, windGlobal, gravityGlobal, mixGlobal,
 *   skinRequired, scaleYMode` — the `PhysicsConstraintData` fields of those
 *   names, the seven pose values off its `setupPose`, `scaleYMode` as the
 *   enum's name (`None`, `Uniform`, `Volume`).
 * - `paths` — one object per path constraint, constraint order: `name, slot,
 *   bones, positionMode, spacingMode, rotateMode, offsetRotation, position,
 *   spacing, mixRotate, mixX, mixY` — `PathConstraintData` and its
 *   `setupPose`, each mode as its enum's name (`Fixed`/`Percent`,
 *   `Length`/`Fixed`/`Percent`/`Proportional`, `Tangent`/`Chain`/`ChainScale`).
 * - `pathAttachments` — one object per path attachment in any skin: `skin,
 *   slot, placeholder, closed, constantSpeed, lengths`, in skin order and, in a
 *   skin, in `Skin.getAttachments()` order. `compare` matches them by
 *   `skin/slot/placeholder`, never by position.
 * - `setup` — the setup pose (below).
 * - `animations` — one object per animation in `SkeletonData.animations`
 *   order: `{ "name", "duration", "samples": [ … ] }`, and each sample is
 *   `{ "t", "events", …pose }`.
 *
 * A **pose** is, in order:
 *
 * - `bones` — `[name, worldX, worldY, a, b, c, d, active, parent]` per bone in
 *   skeleton order, read off `Bone.appliedPose` (`BonePose.worldX` … `.d`, the
 *   world matrix `[a b][c d]` and origin); `active` is `1` or `0`
 *   (`Bone.active`, false for a `skinRequired` bone the skin does not name);
 *   `parent` is the parent bone's name or `null`.
 * - `slots` — `[name, attachment, r, g, b, a, dark, path, blend]` per slot in
 *   setup order, off `Slot.appliedPose`: the attachment's `name` or `null`, the
 *   light colour, `dark` as `[r, g, b]` or `null` when the slot has no dark
 *   colour, and the attachment's `path` (region and mesh attachments, which
 *   default `path` to their name) or `null` for any other attachment or none;
 *   then `blend`, off the slot's data (`SlotData.blendMode`) as its enum's
 *   name — `Normal`, `Additive`, `Multiply`, `Screen` — or `null` when the
 *   runtime holds no mode (it reads a stated `ADDITIVE` so). The blend mode is
 *   data, not pose: a `SlotPose` carries `color`, `darkColor`, `attachment`,
 *   `sequenceIndex` and `deform` and no mode, and an animation leaves it where
 *   setup put it; it is in the row because the renderer draws the posed slot
 *   with it. Of the pose's other two fields, `deform` is in `attachments`'
 *   world vertices and `sequenceIndex` is not dumped (issue #933's report).
 * - `drawOrder` — slot names in the posed draw order
 *   (`Skeleton.drawOrder.appliedPose`).
 * - `attachments` — `[slot, attachment, kind, vertices]` for every slot, in
 *   draw order, whose attachment is a region or a mesh; `kind` is `region` or
 *   `mesh`; `vertices` is the flat `[x0, y0, x1, y1, …]` in world units, y up:
 *   for a region the four corners from
 *   `RegionAttachment.computeWorldVertices(slot, getOffsets(slot.appliedPose),
 *   out, 0, 2)` — in the runtime's corner order, bottom-left, upper-left,
 *   upper-right, bottom-right of the region's own frame — and for a mesh every
 *   vertex from `MeshAttachment.computeWorldVertices(skeleton, slot, 0,
 *   worldVerticesLength, out, 0, 2)`, which applies the slot's deform offsets
 *   and the vertex weights. A slot is listed whether or not its bone is active
 *   and whatever its alpha: this is geometry, not a picture.
 * - `clips` — `[slot, attachment, end, polygon]` for every slot, in draw
 *   order, whose attachment is a clipping attachment: `end` is the name of the
 *   slot the clip ends at (`ClippingAttachment.endSlot`) or `null`, and
 *   `polygon` the world polygon from `computeWorldVertices(skeleton, slot, 0,
 *   worldVerticesLength, out, 0, 2)`.
 * - `clipped` (issue #964) — `[slot, attachment, clipped, vertices, uvs,
 *   triangles]` for every slot drawn while a clip is active, in draw order: a
 *   `SkeletonClipping` walked beside the draw order exactly as `src/render.ts`'s
 *   `piecesOf` walks it — at a clipping attachment `clipEnd(slot)`, then
 *   `clipStart(skeleton, slot, clip)` when the slot's bone is active; at every
 *   other slot, when `isClipping()` and it shows a region or a mesh,
 *   `clipTrianglesUnpacked(world, 0, triangles, triangles.length, uvs, 2)`,
 *   then `clipEnd(slot)`; `clipEnd()` after the walk. `world` is the
 *   attachment's world vertices as `attachments` computes them; `triangles` a
 *   mesh's own and a region's `0 1 2 2 3 0`; `uvs` the attachment's LOCAL ones
 *   — a mesh's `regionUVs` (a linked mesh's are its source's) and a region's
 *   `0 1, 0 0, 1 0, 1 1` in the corner order above — not the page UVs the
 *   renderer passes, because where a region sits on a page is not the
 *   model's (`ModelAtlasRect`'s 🔸 in `src/model.ts`); the clipper's UV rule
 *   is linear (`src/core/clipping.ts`), so the page UVs are the same map of
 *   the same weights. `clipped` is the call's return value, `1` or `0` — the
 *   renderer draws the attachment's own geometry on `0` — and the three
 *   arrays are `clippedVerticesTyped`, `clippedUVsTyped` and
 *   `clippedTrianglesTyped` as returned, whichever it is. Empty when nothing
 *   is drawn under a clip.
 * - `uvs` (issue #967) — `[slot, attachment, page, uvs]` for every slot, in
 *   draw order, whose attachment is a region or a mesh — the slots
 *   `attachments` lists: the frame `index = sequence.resolveIndex(
 *   slot.appliedPose)`, `page` the name of `sequence.regions[index]`'s page
 *   (`TextureAtlasRegion.page.name`, the atlas's page line trimmed) and `uvs`
 *   `sequence.getUVs(index)` as the attachment holds it — a region's four
 *   corners in the corner order above, a mesh's one pair per vertex. These
 *   are what `src/render.ts`'s `pieceOf` draws with; the rules that
 *   reproduce them from the atlas are `src/core/uvs.ts`'s.
 *
 * A sample adds, before its pose:
 *
 * - `t` — the sample's time in seconds.
 * - `events` — `[name, time, int, float, string]` for every event an
 *   `EventTimeline` of the animation fires over `(previous sample's t, t]`,
 *   in firing order; the first sample's interval opens at `-1`, so an event
 *   keyed at 0 fires at the first sample. `string` is the key's, else the
 *   event definition's, else `""` — measured on issue #955, where this line
 *   said `null`: an event declared with no string fired `""`
 *   (`src/core/events.ts`). Events after the last sample are not listed.
 *
 * ## How a pose is posed
 *
 * A skeleton is `new Skeleton(data)` with one skin set before anything is
 * posed: under `--skin all` a new skin named `__all` to which every skin is
 * added in file order (`Skin.addSkin`, later skins overriding earlier ones at
 * the same slot and placeholder); under `--skin <name>` that skin, where the
 * default skin still fills what it does not name (`Skeleton.getAttachment`);
 * under `--skin none` (issue #1051) no skin at all — `setSkin` is never
 * called, the state `render` without `--skin`, A10's walk and `validate()`
 * pose in.
 *
 * Sample times, for an animation of duration `d` and `N` samples, sample `i`
 * from 0: `grid` — `d·i/(N-1)` (and `0` when `N` is 1); `off` —
 * `d·(i+0.5)/N`; `irr` and `dense` — `d·(i+0.381966011)/N`, an offset of
 * `1 − 1/φ` so no sample lands on a key authored on a frame grid. `dense` is
 * `irr`'s formula under its own name, for a dump taken with a large `N`.
 * The formula is held in the core (`sampleTime` in `src/core/animation.ts`)
 * and this tool calls it, as it rounds with `gridRound`, so the two dumpers
 * sample at one set of times. `d` is spine-core's `Animation.duration`: the
 * last key time of every timeline in the animation, as float32 — measured
 * against the model's declared duration on issue #936 (an animation whose
 * bones stop at 1 and whose event fires at 2.5 samples over 2.5).
 *
 * `--physics none` (the default), which is the prototype's posing exactly: one
 * skeleton for the whole dump; the setup pose is `setupPose()` then
 * `updateWorldTransform(Physics.none)`; each sample is `setupPose()`, then
 * `Animation.apply(skeleton, 0, t, false, null, 1, MixFrom.setup, false,
 * false, false)`, then `updateWorldTransform(Physics.none)`. Physics
 * constraints are not simulated: they hold the bones where the animation left
 * them — measured on issue #938, the dump of a rig with its physics
 * constraints and timelines is the dump of the rig without them
 * (`src/core/constraints_physics.ts`).
 *
 * `--physics step --dt <s>`: a fresh skeleton per animation (and one for the
 * setup pose), `setupPose()`, `update(0)` and `updateWorldTransform(Physics.
 * reset)` at time 0 — for an animation after applying it at 0 as below. Then
 * the skeleton is walked forward in one continuous trajectory through every
 * sample in order: from the previous sample's time `p` (0 at the start), for
 * `k = 1, 2, …` while `p + k·dt < t`, one step to `p + k·dt`, and then one step
 * to `t` itself unless the walk is already there. A step to time `s` is
 * `setupPose()`, `Animation.apply(skeleton, last, s, false, null, 1,
 * MixFrom.setup, false, false, false)` — `last` the time the walk last
 * applied the animation at, −1 before the apply at 0 — `update(s − previous
 * s)` and `updateWorldTransform(Physics.update)`; the pose is read after the
 * step to `t` without posing again.
 *
 * ⏱️ **`last`, not 0: the animation is applied as a player applies it**
 * (issue #960). Until then every step applied it from 0, so a physics
 * `reset` key at `k` reset its constraints at EVERY step from `k` on — the
 * rig held still — where a player crosses it once. Measured on a probe (a
 * bone under a physics constraint, `x`, `y` and `rotate` at 1, inertia 0.9,
 * strength 40, damping 0.95, its parent keyed at 0, 0.3, 0.7 and 1, a
 * `reset` key at 0.5; nine grid samples at dt 1/60) under three schedules
 * in full doubles: (a) apply from 0 at every step; (b1) `Animation.apply`
 * from the previous step's time, −1 before the first; (b2) `AnimationState`
 * with one non-looping track, `update(s − previous s)` then `apply` —
 * `src/core/raw.ts`'s recipe, with and without `setupPose()` first. (b1) and
 * (b2) agreed to the bit at every sample, and with reset keys at 0, 0.0001,
 * 0.51, 1, {0, 0.5} and {0.2, 0.6}; (a) agreed with them up to and at the
 * first key after 0 and was off by whole units from the step after it (the
 * bone 30.0, 24.0, 24.6 and 48.1 units off at 0.625, 0.75, 0.875 and 1 on
 * the probe). A key at 0 changes nothing under either reading (the walk
 * resets at 0 anyway) and a key at the last step's time fires in both. So
 * the dump walks (b1): the instrument measures what a player plays, and the
 * core's walk (`resetCrossed` in `src/core/constraints_physics.ts`) crosses
 * a key once — a key in `(last, s]` — with it. Keeping (a) was rejected: it
 * is a schedule no player runs, which both dumpers agreeing on proves
 * nothing about. None of the nineteen tree rows keys a `reset` (the
 * stepped census's `timeline.reset`, `tools/core_gate.ts`), and every
 * stepped dump of them, both dumpers, grid and `--raw`, was byte-identical
 * before and after the change.
 *
 * spine-core integrates physics on its own fixed
 * `step` inside that call, carrying the remainder, so `dt` decides how often
 * the animated bones are re-posed under the simulation, not the integrator.
 * Measured on issue #956 (`src/core/constraints_physics.ts`): the same rig
 * under dt 1/60, 1/30 and 0.025 reads three trajectories — a bone under an
 * `x` spring whose parent moves 60 units a second sat at 4.517945, 4.613321
 * and 4.611427 at t = 0.125 — each reproduced by the core at tolerance 0.
 *
 * ## `dump --core` — the second dumper
 *
 * The same document from rigc's own core (`src/core/index.ts`, issue #925)
 * posing a `rigc-compiled/1` document (`skeleton.model.json`, which `build`
 * writes beside the Spine pair) — no spine-core call is made for it. `dumper`
 * is `"rigc-core"`; `source` is `{ "spine": null, "hash": null }`, since the
 * model states neither; `options` as given. `--skin` is `all` or a skin the
 * model declares (issue #932, `underSkin` and `src/core/skins.ts`): under a
 * named skin a slot shows the named skin's record, else the default skin's,
 * else nothing, and only the named skin's `bones` and constraint lists are
 * applied — the default skin's are not — each measured against the dump
 * above; under `--skin none` the document with no skin set (`noSkinView`,
 * issue #1051: no skin's lists applied, a slot resolved through the default
 * skin alone); a skin the model does not declare is refused (exit 2) by name. Under `--physics step --dt <s>` the core walks the
 * schedule above itself (issue #956, `poseSteppedAnimations` and
 * `stepSchedule` in `src/core/constraints_physics.ts`): the setup pose is the
 * reset pose, every animation a fresh state reset at 0 and stepped through
 * the samples, each physics constraint integrated as that file's header
 * states with its measurements, `options.dt` the `dt` given. The rosters
 * `bones`, `slots`, `skins` and `constraints` are the document's own, in its
 * order, and `physics` is each physics constraint's row as above, written
 * from the model's record with the parser's value for a field it leaves out
 * (`physicsRows`).
 * `paths` and `pathAttachments` are the document's path constraints and path
 * attachments as the runtime reads them (issue #938, second cut,
 * `src/core/constraints_path.ts`). `setup.bones` is the core's setup pose
 * with the document's ik, transform, path, physics and slider constraints
 * applied in its order (issue #938, `src/core/constraints.ts`; under
 * `--physics none` a physics constraint applies nothing, stepped it is
 * reset, and a slider applies its animation), or absent when a path walks a slot whose
 * placeholder skins fill with different curves, or a slider's animation
 * keys a constraint timeline or deforms a walked curve; `setup.slots` is every slot's row as the pose
 * above words it (issue #928), each slider's slot timelines applied after
 * the bones, or absent when a slot's setup placeholder is filled
 * by skins that disagree, since which of them `--skin all` shows is the Spine
 * file's skin order and the model does not carry it (the core's header says
 * why, with the measurements) — a case that arises under `all` only, and
 * that the per-skin dumps judge; `setup.attachments` and `setup.clips` are the
 * world vertices of every region, mesh, linked mesh and clipping polygon shown
 * at setup, in the setup draw order (issue #931, `src/core/vertices.ts`),
 * each slider's deform and sequence keys applied (issue #955), absent when
 * either block above is, and `setup.attachments` also when a shown region's
 * atlas rectangle is `null` in the model or a slider's timeline moves a
 * record several skins fill. `animations` is every animation of
 * the model, in the model's order, sampled at the phase's times over its
 * runtime duration (issue #936, `src/core/animation.ts`): each sample's
 * `bones` and `slots` posed from the setup pose with the animation's bone and
 * slot timelines at alpha 1, then the constraints posed by their timelines
 * at the sample's time, a path walking the curve the sample's deform left —
 * `animations.bones` absent when `setup.bones` is, when an animation keys
 * the attachment of a walked path's slot or deforms a walked path whose
 * placeholder several skins fill, or when a path's offset reads a slot bone from the previous pose
 * whose reflection changes across the samples (under the step: whenever a
 * path's offset reads a slot bone from the previous pose, which is then the
 * previous step's); `animations.slots` absent
 * when a slider keys a slot on such a document or skins disagree over a
 * placeholder a slot shows — and, since issue #955, its `drawOrder` (the
 * sample's draw-order key over the setup order, then each slider's,
 * `src/core/draw_order.ts`), its `attachments` and `clips` (through the
 * sample's bones, in that draw order, with the deform and sequence
 * timelines' state, `src/core/deform.ts`; absent when the bones or the slots
 * are, and the attachments when a timeline moves a record several skins
 * fill) and its `events` (`src/core/events.ts`). `setup.drawOrder` is the slot
 * order with each slider's draw-order key applied. The physics parameters
 * are `null` and named in `absent`.
 * `setup.uvs` and `animations.uvs` (issue #967, `src/core/uvs.ts`) are each
 * pose's page and page UVs, from the atlas given by `--atlas <file>` — the
 * build's `skeleton.atlas`, read by rigc's own reader (`parseAtlasText`,
 * `atlasRegionLookup` in `src/atlas.ts`): the model carries no page layout,
 * so without `--atlas` both blocks are absent, saying so. They are absent
 * too where what a slot shows is not posed (that pose's slots or draw order
 * absent), under `--physics step` when a slider keys a slot's attachment or
 * a sequence, and where `src/core/uvs.ts` names a case it does not pose; an
 * atlas lacking a region the pose draws is refused (exit 2), as spine-core
 * refuses to load the pair.
 *
 * ## `--raw` — full doubles (issue #966)
 *
 * `dump --raw` (either dumper) writes the same document with every number the
 * double as computed — `JSON.stringify` of the number, no grid: `rawNumber`
 * in `src/core/index.ts`, `null` for a value that is not finite and `-0`
 * written `0` as above — under the spec `pose-oracle-raw/3` (`ORACLE_RAW_SPEC`,
 * derived from `ORACLE_SPEC`, so a field added there moves both). Nothing
 * else changes: the fields, their order, the options (which carry no `raw`
 * key — the spec says it), the sample times and the walk. A reader of the
 * rounded spec refuses a raw document by name rather than comparing full
 * doubles on the grid. `compare` reads two raw documents in units in the
 * last place (`ulpDistance`: the count of doubles between the two, `0` and
 * `-0` equal) at tolerance 0, and refuses a raw document against a rounded
 * one, and a `--tol-xy` or `--tol-m` other than 0 on two raw ones (exit 2):
 * a raw comparison has no tolerance to widen. The reports print each delta
 * as `N ulp`. The ill-conditioned rule applies unchanged.
 *
 * ## `compare` — two documents
 *
 * Refused (exit 2) when either file is not a `pose-oracle/4` document, when
 * the two were taken under different `options`, or when a block is absent
 * from BOTH — there is then nothing to compare it with. A block absent from
 * exactly one side prints `SKIP <block>: not produced by <dumper>` (and the
 * absent side's reason) and is neither compared nor counted: IDENTICAL then
 * speaks for the blocks both documents carry, and its line says how many were
 * skipped and which. A sample block is judged the same way inside the
 * animations both documents carry, and not at all when either carries none.
 * Otherwise every roster (bones, slots, skins, animations, constraints, path
 * attachments, sample counts) and every name must agree exactly — skins and
 * animations as sets, matched by name, because the order they are listed in
 * is the Spine file's spelling (the emitter's editor order) and not a pose —
 * and every number within tolerance: world
 * positions and vertex coordinates within `--tol-xy`, everything else (the
 * matrix, colours, times, parameters, page UVs) within `--tol-m`; `uvs` rows
 * matched by slot and attachment as the attachments are, each row's page name
 * and length exactly. Both default to 1e-6,
 * one step of the rounding grid; deltas are computed on the grid, in integer
 * millionths, so a rounding tie cannot read as over.
 *
 * 🔒 The ill-conditioned rule, from the prototype's calibration: at a sample,
 * a bone whose `|a·d − b·c| < 1e-6` in EITHER document is excluded from that
 * sample's comparison, and so is every descendant of it; so are the
 * attachments and clips on the slots of the excluded bones. Excluded
 * bone-samples are counted and printed, never compared. A collapsed matrix's
 * four numbers carry no rotation to agree about, and float noise in them is
 * not a difference between two rigs.
 *
 * Prints `IDENTICAL` and exits 0 when nothing differs; otherwise, per
 * animation, the worst Δxy and Δabcd with the bone and the sample, the count of
 * bone-samples over tolerance, the worst vertex delta, and every roster, name,
 * draw-order and event mismatch by name, then the first difference, and exits
 * 1.
 *
 * 🔒 Not a selftest control in full: grading the corpus is a table, and a
 * table is PR_BODY material. `selftest.ts` holds three rows of it the way it
 * holds `pose_floor` — two dumps of one build byte-identical, a planted 1°
 * named by `compare`, and one public example's rebuild against its export at
 * the reading measured.

// --- #979 unposed: begin ---
/**
 * `unposed` — the bones a posed skin leaves unposed, compared to the bit with
 * their signs of zero (issue #979).
 *
 *   bun tools/pose_oracle.ts unposed <build dir> [--samples 9] [--phase grid|off|irr|dense]
 *                                    [--skin all|none|<name>] [--physics none|step] [--dt 1/60]
 *
 * `compare` never reads these rows: an unposed bone — inactive, or below an
 * inactive bone — holds a zero matrix, so the ill-conditioned rule excludes
 * it and its subtree at every sample, and a document spells `-0` as `0`.
 * Yet a constraint can write into such a bone (issue #968's private reading:
 * a world transform constraint wrote `worldX` 19.99999979 into one; a
 * two-bone ik wrote `-0` into `b` and `d`), and what it wrote is read on: a
 * later constraint taking the bone as its source reads `atan2` of those
 * zeros, where `+0` and `-0` are 0 and 180 degrees apart.
 *
 * So this command poses the build twice in memory — `skeleton.json` and
 * `skeleton.atlas` through spine-core (`dumpSkeleton`), `skeleton.model.json`
 * through the core (`coreDump`) — under the given options, with every number
 * the double as computed and its sign of zero kept (`signedNumber`; nothing
 * is written, so JSON's spelling never reaches it), and compares, at the
 * setup pose and every sample, every bone unposed in EITHER pose (`unposedOf`
 * over the rows' `active` and `parent` columns): `worldX`, `worldY`, `a`,
 * `b`, `c`, `d` by `Object.is`, so `0` against `-0` is a difference and a
 * value that is not finite (`null`) equals only another. It prints each
 * unposed bone's distinct rows on both sides with `-0` spelled, then
 * `IDENTICAL` (exit 0) or `DIFF` and every difference (exit 1). A build with
 * no unposed bone under the options is refused (exit 2): a comparison of
 * nothing is not a pass. A block the core leaves absent is refused by name.
 *
 * ⏳ **HISTORY, by measurement.** Under `--physics none` spine-core poses the
 * build a second time with every sample on a skeleton of its own
 * (`OracleOptions.fresh`). A bone-sample where the two runtime readings
 * disagree by `Object.is` is HISTORY: the runtime's value there depends on
 * the pass before (issue #979 — a constraint writing into an inactive bone),
 * so it is compared with nothing, never folded into IDENTICAL and never
 * counted as DIFF. Each constraint writing into an inactive bone above such
 * a bone prints `HISTORY <kind>/<name> on inactive <bone>: the runtime's value
 * depends on the previous pass — sequential vs fresh differ at N of M
 * samples`, and the verdict line counts them; where the runtime's two
 * readings agree and the core does not, it is DIFF (exit 1). Under
 * `--physics step` no fresh reading is taken — a stepped pass carries the
 * one before by design, and the core walks the same steps — and the header
 * line says so. There a differing bone-sample is HISTORY **by taint, not by
 * measurement**: when its bone is one a constraint writing into an inactive
 * bone reaches (`historyTaint` in src/core/constraints.ts, the walk the core's
 * leak refusal reads), it prints per writer as `HISTORY (by the writer's
 * taint; no fresh reading under the step) <kind>/<name> on inactive <bone>:
 * N of M samples (bones …)` and is counted apart on the verdict line; a
 * differing bone-sample outside the taint stays DIFF (exit 1).

// it walks. With no skin set, the setup pose is posed and every physics state
// reset (`setupPose()`, `update(0)`, `updateWorldTransform(Physics.reset)`);
// then each animation, on a fresh skeleton posed the same way, is set on a
// LOOPING track and stepped `STEP_FRAMES` times by `max(duration, 1) /
// STEP_FRAMES` — `AnimationState.update(step)`, `apply`, `Skeleton.update
// (step)`, `updateWorldTransform(Physics.update)` — one pose read after each.
// A pose is every bone's world transform, every shown region's and mesh's
// world vertices in draw order, every slot's light and dark colour, and the
// track's two times. Every number is the double itself, a non-finite one
// included: the walk is how A10 finds one, so a dumper that rounded or
// refused it would hide the subject. `tools/core_gate.ts --walk` compares
// the two documents over a corpus, and the core suite's `CO25` over the
// tree's rows and a seeded population.
