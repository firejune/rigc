/**
 * emit_hashes — every build in every corpus hashed, and two such hash documents
 * compared across commits (issue #914, step 1a of issue #380).
 *
 *   bun tools/emit_hashes.ts recipes --out <recipes.json>
 *   bun tools/emit_hashes.ts run --recipes <recipes.json> --out <hashes.json>
 *                                [--work <dir>] [--root <dir>]
 *   bun tools/emit_hashes.ts compare <a.json> <b.json>
 *   bun tools/emit_hashes.ts base [--check] [--file <hashes.json>]
 *                                 [--work <dir>] [--root <dir>]
 *
 * ⭐ Why this exists. Step 1 of issue #380 constructs a compiled model before
 * the Spine emitter, and it is gated by byte identity: every build in every
 * corpus writes the same bytes before and after each cut. `A18_DETERMINISTIC_EMIT`
 * compares two compiles inside ONE run of ONE commit; nothing compared a build
 * across two commits. This tool is that instrument, and it is measurement only:
 * it changes nothing under `src/` and nothing in `cli.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ It hashes what lands on disk through the CLI, not what `compile()` returns.
 * `build --pack` and `build --copy-images` write atlas text after `compile` has
 * returned (docs/COMPILED_MODEL.md §5, third bullet), so a gate on the return
 * value would be blind to exactly the emission a refactor is likeliest to move.
 * That is also why this file starts child processes: it runs `bun cli.ts …` as a
 * caller does. `tools/` is not `src/`, so the purity rule does not reach it, and
 * no other module here spawns anything.
 *
 * ## A recipe, and why its inputs are staged
 *
 * A recipe is an ordered list of CLI commands with two placeholders, `{{work}}`
 * (a fresh directory of its own) and `{{out}}` (`{{work}}/out`), plus a list of
 * inputs to copy into `{{work}}` before the first command runs:
 *
 *   { "name": "gallery/flex",
 *     "stage": [{ "from": "gallery/flex", "to": "gallery/flex" }],
 *     "commands": [["build", "--rig", "{{work}}/gallery/flex/rig.json", …,
 *                   "--out", "{{out}}"]] }
 *
 * The last command's `--out` must be `{{out}}`, and the files under it are what
 * gets hashed. A chain stops at the first command that exits non-zero: a
 * `build` over specs an `ingest` refused to finish would measure nothing.
 *
 * 🔒 **The inputs are copied, not read in place, and that is measured rather
 * than tidy.** `build` spells `skeleton.images` and every atlas page name as a
 * path relative to `--out`. A gallery rig built in place into two temp
 * directories one level apart wrote two different skeleton files: its `images`
 * read `../../(nine of them)/Users/…/gallery/look/parts/` in one and ten `../`
 * in the other, and the atlas's page line differed the same way. So a build
 * read in place hashes the location of the checkout and of the work directory,
 * and two commits in two worktrees would read DIFF on every recipe. Staged, the
 * spelling is `../gallery/look/parts/` wherever `{{work}}` is.
 *
 * `from` is resolved against `--root` (default: the checkout this file is in)
 * when relative, taken as given when absolute; `to` is a relative path that
 * stays inside `{{work}}`. `--root` is also how a private corpus is run: its
 * recipes file is written wherever that corpus lives and nothing about it
 * enters this tree — this file needs no code for it.
 *
 * `--recipes` also takes an `emit-hashes/1` document and runs its recipes (its
 * `name`, `stage` and `commands`), so the run after a cut repeats exactly the
 * recipes of the base it will be compared with, without a second file.
 *
 * The CLI that runs is always the one beside this file (`../cli.ts`), with its
 * working directory set to the recipe's `{{work}}`.
 *
 * ## `run` — the document, `"spec": "emit-hashes/1"`
 *
 * `JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2)` and a newline. Key order is fixed and is the
 * order written here; recipes are sorted by `name` and files by `path`, both by
 * UTF-16 code unit (not locale). Two runs of one recipes file write
 * byte-identical documents: nothing about time, the work directory or the host
 * is in it. The run's wall time is printed to stderr and nowhere else.
 *
 * - `spec` — `"emit-hashes/1"`.
 * - `recipes` — one object per recipe:
 *   - `name`, `stage`, `commands` — the recipe exactly as the recipes file
 *     states it, placeholders UNRESOLVED (a resolved command line carries the
 *     work directory, which differs on every run);
 *   - `exits` — the exit code of each command that ran, in order (`null` for a
 *     child ended by a signal); shorter than `commands` when the chain stopped;
 *   - `files` — `{ "path", "size", "sha256" }` for every file under `{{out}}`
 *     after the last command, `path` relative to `{{out}}` with `/`
 *     separators, `sha256` lower-case hex. Empty when nothing was written — a
 *     refused build writes nothing, and that is recorded, not dropped.
 *
 * The per-recipe work directories are kept (numbered in name order, each with a
 * `log-<i>.txt` of every command's output beside `out/`) so a difference can be
 * opened; the root is named on stderr.
 *
 * ## `compare`
 *
 * IDENTICAL (exit 0) when every recipe has the same exits and the same file set
 * with the same sizes and hashes. Otherwise (exit 1), per recipe that differs:
 * exits that differ, each file whose hash differs (with the size on both
 * sides), each file on one side only; and every recipe on one side only. A
 * refused recipe is compared like any other — its exit code is data.
 *
 * Exit 2, by name, when the pair cannot be compared: a missing file, a file
 * that is not an `emit-hashes/1` document, or two documents from different
 * recipe sets — the same recipe name standing for a different `stage` or
 * `commands` on the two sides. A recipe present on one side only is not that:
 * a corpus that grew is a difference to report, while one name meaning two
 * builds would turn every verdict under it into a statement about the recipes.
 *
 * ## `recipes`
 *
 * The recipes for this tree's own corpora, generated from the tree:
 *
 * - every `examples/<ex>/export/<file>.json` — the fetched editor exports —
 *   rebuilt the way docs/COMPILED_MODEL.md §4 built them and the pose oracle's
 *   corpus rows pair them: `ingest --art none` into `{{work}}/specs`, then
 *   `build --atlas-in <pack>` into `{{out}}`, the export directory staged as
 *   `{{work}}/export`. The pack is resolved, not guessed: a directory with one
 *   `.atlas` uses it; a directory with several tries each in file-name order
 *   and takes the first whose chain exits 0 on every command. If none does,
 *   every candidate is written as its own recipe (`<name> [<pack>]`) and
 *   stderr says so, because picking one would be a guess.
 * - every `gallery/<name>/` that has a `rig.json`, with the `build` command its
 *   own README states (the first `bun cli.ts build` line whose `--rig` is that
 *   example's `rig.json`), each `gallery/<name>/…` path moved under
 *   `{{work}}` and the stated `--out` replaced by `{{out}}`. A README that
 *   states no such line is a FINDING printed on stderr, and the recipe takes
 *   the form `gallery/README.md` states for every example.
 *
 * An absent `examples/` is printed as a HOLE on stderr, never silently empty.
 *
 * ## `base` — the tracked base, `tools/emit_hashes.base.json` (issue #930)
 *
 * The five step-1 gates in `selftest.ts` (`MB07`, `MV09`, `MS12`, `MA12`,
 * `MD07`) hold this tree's builds to a base hash document. CI names none, so
 * until #930 each of them printed SKIP and a HOLE on every CI run. The tracked
 * base is what they read when `RIGC_EMIT_HASHES_BASE` is unset; the variable
 * still overrides it with a fuller document (the fetched exports' rows).
 *
 * ⚠️ **That file is a plain `emit-hashes/1` document and nothing else** — JSON
 * carries no comment, so this paragraph is its header. It holds the gallery's
 * rows only: every `gallery/<name>/` with a `rig.json`, built the way its README
 * states (the same recipes `recipes` writes for the gallery). The fetched
 * exports are left out because `examples/` is gitignored and absent in CI, so a
 * row for them would be a row no CI run can build.
 *
 * 🔸 **It carries the Spine files only — `skeleton.json` and the atlas — and
 * leaves `skeleton.model.json` out of every row**, because the model document
 * is measured NOT to be machine-independent. The base taken on the machine it
 * was written on read STALE on the first Linux CI run (PR #941, run
 * 36548303780) on exactly one row and one file: `gallery/look`'s
 * `skeleton.model.json`, 394523 bytes `6e0960b0a4c2` in the file against 394529
 * bytes `e15d81552ae1` on CI, while `skeleton.json` and `skeleton.atlas` were
 * identical on all seven rows. The field #942 found is not a six-decimal one:
 * it is a carried report, `meshes[].depth.ceiling.*.degrees`/`p1`, spelled as a
 * full double from `Math.atan` until #942's closing cut put it on the r6 grid
 * (macOS's atan sits 0.512 ulp below the correctly rounded value Linux
 * returns); every r6 field of the 19 recipes moved by no byte under a ±1 ulp
 * perturbation of every libm function. So the base
 * holds the Spine files only on every machine, and a fuller document named by
 * `RIGC_EMIT_HASHES_BASE` still
 * holds every file, the model document included. `MD07` reads this base in its
 * original sense: every row differs from it by exactly the added document.
 *
 * 🔒 **It is written by one command and never by hand**: `bun tools/emit_hashes.ts
 * base` regenerates it in place, and `--file` writes it elsewhere. A gallery row
 * that exits non-zero is refused by name and nothing is written, because a base
 * is a record of green builds. `base --check` builds the same rows afresh and
 * compares the result with the file BYTE for byte: CURRENT exits 0; STALE exits
 * 1 with each differing row and file and the command that refreshes it. A file
 * whose hashes all agree but whose bytes do not is STALE too — that is a file
 * somebody edited, which is the one way it may not change. `selftest.ts`'s
 * `EH06` runs the check on the tree and `EH07` plants a moved gallery build.
 *
 * Exit codes throughout: 0 done (or IDENTICAL, or CURRENT), 1 DIFF (or STALE),
 * 2 a bad input by name.
