/**
 * pack_anchor — where a `polygon` pack's candidates may put a cell, measured
 * over a corpus: how many cells have an owned box inset from their cell's
 * corner, how many candidates the owned box's anchor refuses for that reason
 * alone, and what the pack finds under each footprint rule alone
 * (`FOOTPRINT_ANCHORS`: `box`, `box-or-cell`, `box-else-cell`, `best-of`) and
 * as `polygon` packs — the whole pack of least Σ page area among `rect` and
 * `POLYGON_CANDIDATE_RULES` (issue #1104).
 *
 *   bun tools/pack_anchor.ts [--recipes <recipes.json>] [--root <dir>] [--regions <set.json>]…
 *                            [--seeds <n,n,…>] [--padding <n>] [--page-size <n>] [--work <dir> | --keep-work] [--json <out.json>]
 *                            [--trace-regions <tolerance>]
 *
 * With no source flag, the tree's own: `fixtures/polypack_shapes.ts`'s two
 * seeds (`POLYPACK_SEED`, `POLYPACK_GAIN_SEED`) and `tools/emit_hashes.ts`'s
 * `treeRecipes` (every gallery rig, and every fetched editor export when
 * `examples/` is there). The sources a flag names replace that default:
 *
 *   * `--recipes` takes an `emit-hashes-recipes/1` or `emit-hashes/1` document
 *     and `--root` resolves its stages, the way `hull_ceiling` and
 *     `verdict_gate` take them — a private corpus keeps its recipes with it and
 *     only the table leaves it, which names recipes and nothing else;
 *   * `--regions` (repeatable) takes a region set as a JSON array, or an object
 *     whose `regions` is one: each entry `width` (or `w`), `height` (or `h`) and
 *     `hull` — a flat `[x0, y0, x1, y1, …]` loop in the region's own texels, x
 *     right and y down — and optionally `region` (or `name`). Each region is
 *     written as a plate opaque inside its hull, as `writePolypackInputs`
 *     writes the generated sets, and packed by that hull;
 *   * `--seeds` takes generator seeds for `polypackShapes`.
 *
 * ## What a built recipe is packed as
 *
 * Every region the build's atlas states, once by name (a later region of the
 * same name is counted, not packed), lifted off its page at its drawing's size
 * (`originalWidth x originalHeight`, `extractRegion`) — the loose part a
 * `--pack` build of that drawing would pack — with the footprint
 * `packFootprints` reads off the build's `skeleton.json`, as `build --pack
 * --pack-shape polygon` reads it. A recipe built `--atlas-in` therefore packs
 * the parts of the pack it was handed, the editor's whitespace strip undone.
 *
 * ## The row
 *
 *   * **cells**, **mesh cells** (an owned set that is not the whole cell) and
 *     **inset** — cells whose owned box does not start at the cell's corner,
 *     with the distribution of the inset `(dx, dy)` in cell texels;
 *   * **first pass**: one footprint pass of every cell on an empty
 *     `page-size x page-size` page, first anchor only, run to its end
 *     (`footprintPass`) — the candidates it refused only because the cell
 *     would leave the page (`PassTally.boxAnchorRefused`) and the cells it
 *     missed although a free rectangle held their box (`missedByAnchor`);
 *   * **pages** under `--page-edges free` and `pot`: `rect`, every rule alone and
 *     `polygon` (with the candidate it kept), each as page sizes and Σ area, a
 *     page marked `>box` where it is larger than the owned box's anchor alone
 *     and `>rect` where it is larger than `rect`'s;
 *   * **cost** (`free`): free-list splits over every search the pack ran, the
 *     spill's assignment pass included (`PackOptions.tally`) — `PK93`'s unit;
 *     `polygon`'s is its three candidate packs together;
 *   * **deterministic**: every column's pack made twice, and once more with its
 *     parts handed over reversed, byte-identical — atlas text and every page's
 *     pixels — under both edge modes.
 *
 * `--padding` and `--page-size` apply to every set of the run, generated,
 * `--regions` and recipe alike: a set with one region whose cell does not fit
 * a `--page-size` page is a refused row, so a corpus with a drawing past 2048
 * is measured with `--page-size 4096` (every set of the run then at 4096).
 *
 * ## `--trace-regions <tolerance>`: the stage-2 realised figure (issue #1115)
 *
 * Every built set is packed `polygon` twice more, with every **region-kind**
 * region (one any region attachment samples — `hull_ceiling`'s definition)
 * packed by the contour rigc's tracer states for its art, converted in memory
 * and read back through `packFootprints` (`tools/trace_footprint.ts`); mesh-kind
 * regions keep the footprint they pack by today, and nothing on disk changes.
 * `traced:0` is the corner-lattice outline at threshold 1, unsimplified and with
 * no margin — the polygon `hull_ceiling`'s *regions traced* ceiling counts;
 * `traced:t=<tolerance>` is `buildContourMesh` at that tolerance and the contour
 * generator's defaults for the rest (margin 1, maxVertices 64, alpha 1). The
 * flag's value is that tolerance because the generator has none to default to.
 * A fourth table states, per set and edge mode, Σ page area and its ratio to
 * `rect` for `polygon` and both tightnesses, and how many region-kind regions
 * packed by contour (a refused one keeps its rectangle and is counted by
 * reason); `--json` carries it per set as `traced`. Seed and `--regions` sets
 * have no build and no region attachment, and carry no reading. The seconds
 * each tightness took go to stderr. Without the flag nothing printed changes.
 *
 * ## Refused rows
 *
 * A set nothing can be measured on is a **REFUSED** row carrying the sentence
 * that refused it — a build chain that exited non-zero, an atlas the lift
 * cannot read, or the packer's own refusal (a region whose cell does not fit
 * the page: the packer cannot split one drawing across two pages, and is right
 * to refuse). Every other set is measured; the Σ rows are over the measured
 * sets and say how many were refused, as `hull_ceiling` prints its rows.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 at least one set measured (refused rows, if any, are named in
 * the table and on stderr); 2 no set measured, or a bad input by name. The wall
 * time is printed on stderr only, so two runs print the same table.
