/**
 * core_gate — the equivalence gate of issue #380 run over a corpus: every
 * recipe built through the CLI, its Spine build posed by spine-core and its
 * model document posed by rigc's own core, the two compared, and the census of
 * what the corpus reaches (issue #925, step 2a; the slots, issue #928; the
 * attachments' world vertices and the clipping polygons, issue #931).
 *
 *   bun tools/core_gate.ts [--recipes <recipes.json>] [--root <dir>] [--work <dir>] [--raw | --walk]
 *
 * `--raw` (issue #966) runs every dump below under `pose_oracle.ts dump
 * --raw` — full doubles, both dumpers — and every `compare` at tolerance 0
 * in ulps: the census of last-bit gaps the grid hides. The verdict line is
 * prefixed `RAW`, each row's worst deltas are in ulps, and before it one
 * `RAW` line per block (`rawCensusLines`) counts the rows exact, off and
 * skipped, the worst distance and its row, then the stepped and per-skin
 * runs the same way.
 *
 * With no `--recipes`, the tree's own: `tools/emit_hashes.ts`'s `treeRecipes`
 * (every fetched editor export and every gallery rig — nineteen when
 * `examples/` is fetched), staged and built exactly as `emit_hashes run`
 * builds them (`runRecipes`), so the same rows are measured here and there.
 * `--recipes` takes an `emit-hashes-recipes/1` or `emit-hashes/1` document and
 * `--root` resolves its stages, which is how a private corpus is run: its
 * recipes live with it and only the printed figures leave it.
 *
 * ## Per row
 *
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts`'s two dumpers on the build in `{{out}}`: `dump` of
 * `skeleton.json` + `skeleton.atlas` (spine-core) and `dump --core` of
 * `skeleton.model.json`, both under the default options (grid, nine samples,
 * every skin, no physics), then `compare`. Each block the core poses —
 * `setup.bones`, `setup.slots`, `setup.drawOrder`, `setup.attachments`,
 * `setup.clips`, `setup.clipped`, and a sample's `bones`, `slots`,
 * `drawOrder`, `attachments`, `clips`, `clipped` and `events` (`GATE_BLOCKS`;
 * the sample's draw order, attachments, clips and events and the setup's draw
 * order since issue #955, both `clipped` blocks since issue #964, with a
 * clipping census — `CLIPPED_CENSUS_FIELDS` — off the spine-core dump; both
 * `uvs` blocks since issue #967, the core reading the build's
 * `skeleton.atlas` beside the model, judged at tolerance 0 and with a census
 * of what they reach — `UV_CENSUS_FIELDS`) — is
 * judged on its own, by a
 * `compare` of the spine-core dump against the core's with the other posed
 * blocks left out, and reads:
 *
 *   - `IDENTICAL` — the block agrees;
 *   - `SKIP` — the core left the block out, with the construct it names (a
 *     path walking a slot whose placeholder skins fill differently, or
 *     another case `src/core/constraints_path.ts` names, or a slider keying a
 *     constraint timeline, for the bones — every constraint kind is posed
 *     since issue #938; a slider keying a slot on such a row, or skins
 *     disagreeing over a placeholder — under the merged view only, and
 *     judged per skin below — for the slots; either of those, a shown
 *     region whose atlas rectangle is `null`, or a deform or sequence
 *     timeline moving a record several skins fill, for the attachments; a
 *     slider keying the draw order on a row whose bones are absent, for the
 *     draw order), so the row holds nothing about it;
 *   - `DIFF` — with the first difference.
 *
 * The row's own verdict is `DIFF` when any block is (or the whole comparison
 * is), `IDENTICAL` when every block is, `SKIP` otherwise — naming the blocks
 * skipped — and `REFUSED` when the build chain exited non-zero or a document
 * could not be read; a refused row is not measured and says why. Under the
 * row, one line per animation (issue #936): its verdict on each sample
 * block, and the first difference of a DIFF.
 *
 * ## Per skin (issue #932)
 *
 * The run above poses every skin merged (`--skin all`), which is the
 * instrument's view and not a state a runtime is ever in: a placeholder
 * several skins fill shows the last of them in the Spine file's order,
 * which the model does not hold, so the core leaves such a block out. A row
 * whose model declares several skins is therefore run once more per skin,
 * both dumpers under `--skin <name>` (the named skin's record, else the
 * default skin's; the named skin's bones and constraint lists alone —
 * `src/core/skins.ts`), each block judged alone as above, the stepped run
 * too. A block the merged run leaves out and every skin's run poses is
 * judged by those runs — DIFF when any skin's is, IDENTICAL otherwise, its
 * reason saying so — and a skin's DIFF makes the row DIFF, naming the skin.
 * The merged run stays: it is what the rosters are compared on, and a
 * block it poses is judged there as before. A row declaring one skin (or
 * none) is not run again: its one skin and the merged view are the same
 * pose — measured on the nineteen tree rows, spine-core's dump under
 * `--skin <its skin>` equals its `--skin all` dump in every block
 * (`CN05`) — so the per-skin runs cost nothing on a one-skin corpus. Each
 * skin's verdict prints under its row, the verdict line counts the rows
 * declaring several skins and their runs, and a corpus with none prints a
 * `per skin` HOLE.
 *
 * ## The stepped run (issue #956)
 *
 * Every row is dumped a second time by both dumpers under `--physics step
 * --dt 1/60` (`STEPPED_OPTIONS`, the oracle's default `dt`, the same nine
 * grid samples) and its `setup.bones` and `animations.bones` judged alone,
 * the `physics` parameter block with each — both phases on every run, not a
 * flag: the stepped share of a run over the nineteen tree rows measured
 * 0.56 s and 1.67 s on two runs of a shared machine, against builds that
 * take the rest of its half-minute. A row declaring a physics constraint,
 * or one whose stepped verdict is not IDENTICAL, prints the `dt` its two
 * documents state (they must state the same one, or the row is DIFF) and,
 * per animation, the steps the schedule takes to reach each sample from the
 * one before (`stepSchedule` in `src/core/constraints_physics.ts`; the first
 * sample, at 0, takes none: it is the reset pose). A stepped DIFF turns the
 * run RED, and the verdict line counts the stepped verdicts after the rest.
 *
 * ## The census
 *
 * One line per row: bones, the inherit modes the model states (a bone that
 * states none inherits `normal`), and how many bones state each field a
 * setup pose reads — `length`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `shearX`, `shearY`,
 * `skinRequired` — plus three conditions: a negative scale, a rotation of 360
 * degrees or more in magnitude, and a parent whose setup world matrix
 * reflects (determinant below 0 in the spine-core dump). A mode or field no
 * row whose `setup.bones` was compared reaches is printed as a HOLE: the gate
 * held nothing about it, and that is the finding.
 *
 * And one line per row for the slots (`SLOT_CENSUS_FIELDS`, issue #928): a
 * second skin, a setup placeholder several skins fill (and those that
 * disagree), a `null` setup attachment, a placeholder no skin fills, a stated
 * colour (and one of six digits), a dark colour (and one of eight digits), a
 * stated blend mode by the mode it reads (`blendNormal`, `blendAdditive`,
 * `blendMultiply`, `blendScreen`; a slot stating none reads `Normal` and is
 * judged on every compared row), a shown record whose name is not its
 * placeholder or whose path is not its name, each kind shown at setup, a slot
 * on an inactive bone, and a slider whose animation keys a slot. Each field no
 * row whose `setup.slots` was compared reaches is a HOLE. The blend mode is
 * the slot row's last cell since issue #933, so a stated one is judged like
 * every other field.
 *
 * And one line per row for the animations (`ANIMATION_CENSUS_FIELDS`, issue
 * #936): the timelines of each bone and slot kind, the keys by the curve that
 * leaves them, the gate's sample times before a timeline's first key and after
 * its last, a bone keyed by two timelines posing one channel, and — since
 * issue #955, which replaced the one `laterTimelines` HOLE — construct 4's
 * remainder per kind: deform timelines (weighted, on a path, on a clipping
 * polygon, played by a linked mesh; Bézier and stepped segments; partial
 * runs and keys with no run; in a slider's animation), sequence timelines,
 * draw-order timelines (restores; a slider's) and events (a payload stated),
 * each judged on the block it changes (`REMAINDER_CENSUS_BLOCKS`). A field no
 * row whose block was compared reaches is a HOLE. Then one `KIND` line per
 * timeline kind — deform, sequence, draw order, events — the rows carrying
 * it that are judged on its block, and those that stay SKIP.
 *
 * And one line per row for the constraints (`CONSTRAINT_CENSUS_FIELDS`, issue
 * #938): the ik and transform constraints and what each states, their
 * timelines, and the update order's two effects — a constraint reading a bone
 * an earlier one moved, and a world-space edit a later one re-poses — each a
 * HOLE when no row whose bones were compared reaches it; the physics
 * constraints and their timelines, and the slider's forms, flags, what its
 * animation keys and its timelines, likewise; the kinds
 * no cut poses yet (`later`) a HOLE however many rows declare one, and a
 * `NONE` line saying so when no kind is left to a later cut.
 *
 * And one line per row for the stepped phase (`STEPPED_CENSUS_FIELDS`, issue
 * #956): each component a physics constraint drives, each setting it states
 * off the parser's value, each timeline kind keyed, the timeline naming no
 * constraint, a `mix` of 0, two constraints on one bone, one physics bone
 * below another and a skin-required constraint — each a HOLE when no row
 * the stepped run judged IDENTICAL reaches it, which the core suite's `CK`
 * probes hold (it replaces issue #938's `physics.stepped` HOLE).
 *
 * And one line per row for the path constraints (`PATH_CENSUS_FIELDS`, issue
 * #938's second cut): every mode and setting the walk reads, the curve each
 * walks, a percent position past an open path's ends, which slot bone the
 * offset reads, a slot showing no path, a path after a constraint that moves
 * what it reads, and the three timelines — each a HOLE when no compared row
 * reaches it, which the core suite's `CP11` holds to a probe. Then one `KIND`
 * line per constraint kind: the rows declaring it that are judged and those
 * that stay SKIP.
 *
 * And one line per row for the attachments (`ATTACHMENT_CENSUS_FIELDS`, issue
 * #931), each a count of slots whose setup attachment has it: a weighted mesh,
 * a mesh bound to several bones, a mesh bound to a bone whose setup world
 * matrix reflects or shears (off the spine-core dump), a linked mesh, a
 * trimmed region, a region with non-unit scale or a rotation, a region under
 * a negative scale or a reflecting bone, a region with a sequence, a region
 * whose rectangle is `null`, a clipping polygon and one ending at a slot, a
 * bounding box and a path attachment. Each field no row whose block was
 * compared reaches is a HOLE; ⚠️ a bounding box and a path are HOLEs on every
 * corpus, since the oracle's dump writes no vertices for either, and a trim
 * is reached only from a pack that trims, which the public examples do not.
 *
 * ## No skin set (issue #1051)
 *
 * After the census, the rows posed with no skin set — both dumpers under
 * `--skin none` (`NOSKIN_OPTIONS`; `--raw` with the run), the state `render`
 * without `--skin`, A10's walk and `validate()` pose in: each corpus row
 * whose document declares skins and no `default` one, or a `default` skin
 * naming a skin-required bone or constraint (`noSkinClass`), and three
 * hand-written probes built through `ingest` and `compile`
 * (`noSkinProbeSkeleton`: no default skin, a default skin naming members, a
 * plain default for contrast). Each prints a `NOSKIN` line — every posed
 * block judged alone, the stepped run under the same option, and every bone
 * unposed in either pose compared to the bit (`compareUnposed`, the
 * runtime's fresh reading classing HISTORY) — then a `NO SKIN` verdict line;
 * a corpus with no row in the class prints a HOLE naming the probes as the
 * only reading. A DIFF or REFUSED there turns the run RED. `--walk` walks the
 * same three probes beside the inactive-bone ones.
 *
 * ## `--walk` — A10's walk (issue #1025, cut 4c-5a)
 *
 * `bun tools/core_gate.ts --walk [--recipes …] [--root …] [--work …]` builds
 * the same rows and runs, instead of everything above, A10's walk on both
 * sides (`spineWalkDocument` and `coreWalkDocument` in `./pose_oracle.ts`):
 * the setup pose with every physics state reset, then every animation on a
 * LOOPING track stepped 120 times by `max(duration, 1) / 120`, every pose's
 * times, bone terms, drawn vertices and slot colours compared at tolerance 0
 * (`Object.is`: a NaN equals a NaN, −0 is not 0). One line per row —
 * `IDENTICAL`, `DIFF` with the first difference, `SKIP` where the core refuses
 * the document by name, `REFUSED` where the build chain failed — then a
 * `WALK` verdict line counting rows (the corpus's, then the inactive-bone
 * probes `walkProbes` builds in memory and the no-skin probes
 * `noSkinWalkProbes` builds under the work directory), poses, numbers, the steps past the
 * duration (the wrap) and the poses holding a non-finite value — and, where
 * any, the numbers on bones the view leaves inactive that a constraint writes
 * into (HISTORY, issue #979: the runtime keeps such a bone's previous step,
 * the core does not; `walkHistory` in src/core/walk.ts), counted apart with
 * their writers and how many differ only in the sign of zero, compared with
 * nothing. Exit 0 when
 * no row is DIFF or REFUSED and some pose was compared, 1 otherwise. The
 * default and `--raw` runs print what they printed before it.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 when every row is IDENTICAL or SKIP; 1 when any row is DIFF or
 * REFUSED, or its stepped run or any skin's run is DIFF, or a no-skin row is
 * DIFF or REFUSED; 2 on a bad input, by name. `tools/` is not `src/`: this file runs
 * child processes (through `runRecipes`) and reads the disk.
