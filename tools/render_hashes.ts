/**
 * render_hashes — every render of every build in every corpus hashed, and two
 * such documents compared across commits (issue #965, step 3a of issue #380).
 *
 *   bun tools/render_hashes.ts run --recipes <recipes.json> --out <hashes.json>
 *                                  [--work <dir> | --keep-work] [--root <dir>]
 *   bun tools/render_hashes.ts compare <a.json> <b.json>
 *   bun tools/render_hashes.ts base [--check] [--file <hashes.json>]
 *                                   [--work <dir> | --keep-work] [--root <dir>]
 *
 * ⭐ Why this exists. Step 3 of issue #380 moves `src/render.ts` from posing
 * through spine-core to posing through rigc's own core, and its gate is "the
 * same renders, bit-identical, on every corpus". Before this file nothing held
 * a render's bytes: the selftest's render controls compare a run against itself
 * (two exports in one run) or against a reference within a tolerance, and
 * `tools/emit_hashes.ts` stops at the Spine files. This tool is the render
 * half of that instrument, and it is measurement only: it changes nothing under
 * `src/` and nothing in `cli.ts`.
 *
 * ## A row
 *
 * The recipes are `tools/emit_hashes.ts`'s, read by its own reader: an
 * `emit-hashes-recipes/1` file (`bun tools/emit_hashes.ts recipes --out …`
 * writes the tree's 19), an `emit-hashes/1` document, or a `render-hashes/1`
 * document, whose recipes are then re-run exactly. `--root` is how a private
 * corpus is run, as there. Each recipe's build chain runs through
 * `emit_hashes.ts`'s `runRecipe` into `{{work}}`, and then, when it exited 0:
 *
 * 1. **the CLI's render**, `RENDER_COMMAND` below, as a caller runs it: every
 *    animation at the protocol rate (12 fps, the CLI's default), each set's
 *    frames, its contact sheet and its `geometry.json`, and `frames.json`,
 *    whose `viewport` is the framing box. Hashed as `render/<path>`.
 * 2. **what the CLI does not write and the posing seam still produces**, in
 *    this process through `src/render.ts`: the setup pose drawn over the same
 *    viewport (`extra/setup.png` — a skeleton with animations never writes it),
 *    and every bone snapshot of every sampled frame with the fields no file
 *    carries (`rotationX/Y`, `scaleX/Y`, which `bonedist` reads), one JSON
 *    line per frame (`extra/bones/<set>.jsonl`). Hashed as `extra/<path>`.
 *
 * The framing box's numbers are recorded in the row as well (`framing`), off
 * `frames.json` — a box that moved is named by the number that moved rather
 * than by every frame it re-seated.
 *
 * ## `run` — the document, `"spec": "render-hashes/1"`
 *
 * `JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2)` and a newline; key order fixed as written
 * here; recipes sorted by `name` and files by `path`, both by UTF-16 code
 * unit. Nothing about time, the work directory or the host is in it; the wall
 * time goes to stderr only.
 *
 * - `spec`; `render` — the render command, placeholders unresolved;
 * - `recipes[]` — `name`, `stage`, `commands` as the recipes state them;
 *   `exits` — the build chain's exit codes; `renderExit` — the render's (`null`
 *   when the chain refused and nothing was rendered); `framing` —
 *   `frames.json`'s viewport, or `null`; `files` — `{ path, size, sha256 }`,
 *   and on every PNG also `pixels` — `{ width, height, sha256 }` over the
 *   image as `tools/plate.ts`'s `decodePng` reads it (see *Two hashes*).
 *
 * ### Two hashes per PNG, and which one is the render
 *
 * The file's bytes are the PNG encoder's output as much as the renderer's,
 * and the encoder is not the same on every machine: the first Linux CI run
 * of this tool (PR #972) read `gallery/flex`'s `gust/contact.png` as 24,444
 * bytes in the macOS base and 24,541 on Linux, and every gallery row DIFF, on
 * a tree whose renderer had not moved. A render is its pixels, so a PNG also
 * carries `pixels.sha256`: SHA-256 over the width and the height (4 bytes
 * each, big-endian) and then the RGBA rows top to bottom as `decodePng`
 * returns them. Re-encoding one frame at deflate level 1 instead of 9, on the
 * machine this was written on, changed its bytes and not that hash; moving one
 * pixel's red by one changed it.
 *
 * The work directories are kept (numbered in name order, each with the build
 * logs, `log-render.txt`, `out/`, `render/` and `extra/`) and named on stderr.
 *
 * ## `compare`
 *
 * IDENTICAL (exit 0) when every row has the same exits, framing numbers and
 * files. When the only files whose bytes differ are PNGs whose pixels agree,
 * the verdict is **IDENTICAL IN PIXELS** (exit 0), naming each such file under
 * a `BYTES` line — an encoder difference, not a render difference, and said
 * rather than folded into either of the other two answers. Otherwise DIFF
 * (exit 1), naming per row the exits, each framing number and each file that
 * differs — a PNG by its pixel hashes whenever both sides carry them, anything
 * else by its bytes — and every row on one side only. Exit 2
 * when the pair cannot be compared: not a `render-hashes/1` document, two
 * different render commands, or one recipe name standing for two builds.
 *
 * ## `base` — `tools/render_hashes.base.json`
 *
 * The gallery's rows, rendered on this tree — every `gallery/<name>/` with a
 * `rig.json`, built the way its README states (`emit_hashes.ts`'s
 * `galleryRecipes`). The fetched exports are left out because a tracked base
 * must be reproducible from a fresh checkout with no network; CI uploads a run
 * over all nineteen rows as the `render-hashes-linux` artifact instead.
 *
 * 🔸 **It holds the PNGs' PIXEL hashes only** — each file as `{ path, pixels }`
 * with no `size` or `sha256` — **with `framing` null in every row**, because
 * those are the files measured to survive a change of libm and the rest are
 * measured not to. With every transcendental `Math` function's result moved by
 * one ulp (either direction, chosen per input), over the 19 recipes on the
 * machine this was written on: 0 of 2,681 PNGs moved, and every `geometry.json`
 * (54), every `frames.json` (19), every bone snapshot file (73) and all 19
 * framing boxes moved — they carry full doubles off `Math.cos`/`Math.sin`, and
 * macOS's and Linux's libm were measured apart once already (`Math.atan`,
 * `tools/emit_hashes.ts` `## base`). So the tracked base is the half a second
 * machine can be held to, and a `run` document — every file and number — is
 * the gate between two commits on ONE machine. What the perturbation did not
 * reach was the PNG encoder, and CI measured it: the file bytes differ between
 * macOS and Linux (*Two hashes*), so the base holds pixels and `base --check`
 * compares pixels. It is
 * written by one command (`base`) and never by hand; `base --check` renders the
 * rows afresh and compares the file BYTE for byte: CURRENT exits 0, STALE exits
 * 1 naming each differing row and file and the command that rewrites it. A
 * gallery row that does not render green is refused and nothing is written.
 *
 * Exit codes throughout: 0 done (or IDENTICAL, or CURRENT), 1 DIFF (or STALE),
 * 2 a bad input by name.
