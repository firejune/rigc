# Changelog

## [2.20.4](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.20.3...v2.20.4) (2026-10-08)


### Performance Improvements

* **mesh:** a region's rows are carried from the last step too — the art-pixel set of a region computed once per call, hull membership and nearest vertex re-measured only where a step changed them, edge predicates keyed by their ends — byte-identical on 19 recorded inputs, demo/bottomwear with one region 2,575 s → 10–11 s on Nova WSL ([#1253](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1253)) ([#1255](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1255)) ([e0e58df](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e0e58df5afe71b7749064d46af1c7f6aad86593a))

## [2.20.3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.20.2...v2.20.3) (2026-10-08)


### Instrument

* **release:** the publish gate is the same sharded selftest CI runs — one reusable workflow called by both, and prepublishOnly accepts only that run's merged tally for the exact commit, else runs the full selftest as before ([#1249](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1249)) ([#1250](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1250)) ([40c2355](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/40c23555e76180dd2e1f9f4937570015ae5ff880))

## [2.20.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.20.1...v2.20.2) (2026-10-08)


### Performance Improvements

* **mesh:** each reduction step is measured by carrying the last step's rasters, distance transform and edge distances through the few triangles a removal changes — byte-identical on 18 recorded parts inputs, demo/bottomwear 32–34 s → 3.0–3.2 s on Nova WSL, 1101 candidates both ([#1246](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1246)) ([#1247](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1247)) ([b74a01d](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b74a01d6a641e0aa1ed997a85f7f52ea572a773e))

## [2.20.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.20.0...v2.20.1) (2026-10-08)


### Performance Improvements

* **mesh:** reduceMesh takes the art's rasters once per call and hands them to every step — outputs byte-identical on 18 recorded parts inputs and every fixture, demo/bottomwear 138–185 s → 76–79 s on one loaded machine ([#1240](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1240)) ([#1242](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1242)) ([3de9084](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/3de9084b16da731b97472ca307a35e96eeba5f55))


### Instrument

* **smoke:** record SourceMesh and RefinementRegion as observed on spine-rigc/mesh — spine-parts c03dd8a's automatic mode uses them, which rigc[#1238](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1238) D1 found no row recording ([#1241](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1241)) ([#1244](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1244)) ([59e73b1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/59e73b172dafd8d4acf4622ec7a701d2470c92a1))

## [2.20.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.19.1...v2.20.0) (2026-10-08)


### Features

* **mesh:** compareMeshesInMotion through the core poser — UV-carried samples, input equality, the motion section of mesh-quality-report/1 — C1 of [#1230](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1230) ([#1233](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1233)) ([3604330](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/36043309ac2e81f5d0dd813461866fbd321a6a47))
* **mesh:** the spine-rigc/meshcompare entry, held by the install smoke running a comparison with no spine-core installed, and the last eight motion controls — every control the [#1221](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1221) contract lists now exists and prints (C2 of [#1230](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1230)) ([#1235](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1235)) ([2fa7d4a](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/2fa7d4a439b7c7318f1ac313c48782245d092234))


### Bug Fixes

* **mesh:** contour and ring generators emit every triangle counter-clockwise in Spine world, as grid, segments and ribbon already did — CT15 holds every generator to it, a comparison over a contour build is now accepted, and gallery/flex's skeleton bytes move ([#1236](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1236)) ([#1237](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1237)) ([6264fd8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6264fd8d4a2b7050c6f0d97e9952c8dd678846c0))

## [2.19.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.19.0...v2.19.1) (2026-10-07)


### Bug Fixes

* **mesh:** a region's density bound exempts only an edge whose contact with the region's active domain is a single point on the band's outer boundary — one predicate shared by measure and refine, the coarse quad converges, seven controls and a plant ([#1229](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1229)) ([#1231](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1231)) ([92bf679](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/92bf6792eb35653e9dcd9252c9f5d579f4bb12bb))

## [2.19.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.18.0...v2.19.0) (2026-10-07)


### Features

* **mesh:** reduceMesh on spine-rigc/mesh — vertex removal with retriangulation and region refinement as two composed operations, every step held to measureMeshQuality, deform runs remapped on removal and refused by name on insertion, ten more MQ controls (B2 of [#1224](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1224)) ([#1227](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1227)) ([b6a186d](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b6a186d1fdb7a7257837ce046988fc9f09f1e9e8))

## [2.18.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.17.1...v2.18.0) (2026-10-07)


### Features

* **mesh:** measureMeshQuality and the mesh-quality-report/1 document on spine-rigc/mesh — the geometry rows of the [#1221](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1221) contract, five row states, raster sensitivity in the row's unit, and 22 MQ controls (B1 of [#1224](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1224)) ([#1225](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1225)) ([d1f7c2e](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d1f7c2e18783eb071831dbce2594f325b1925d01))

## [2.17.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.17.0...v2.17.1) (2026-10-07)


### Instrument

* **installs:** run the install smoke on macOS, Windows and Linux at Bun 1.2.0 in installs-matrix, repair four Windows assumptions in the smoke, and stop its without-bun control going red when two buns are on PATH ([#1219](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1219)) ([fdb2cf3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/fdb2cf3844ee7fe46f93d2eee2218f6fa48b9de9))

## [2.17.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.16.0...v2.17.0) (2026-10-07)


### Features

* **cli:** build and repack take --report &lt;file&gt; and write a build-report/1 JSON document of what their printed report states — rows, summary, stats, supplier, pack figures — byte-identical for one build, never in --out, with the lines unchanged ([#1217](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1217)) ([e518433](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e518433487fe7e8ffff9b17c964ec43494653554)), closes [#1213](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1213)

## [2.16.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.15.1...v2.16.0) (2026-10-07)


### Features

* **package:** name spine-rigc/rig, /mesh and /errors, hold and call every symbol the dependant imports from the install, and read a candidate against that dependant before a release is approved ([#1215](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1215)) ([72f3280](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/72f3280257d0ac28958c343e210805b85f144f85)), closes [#1212](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1212)

## [2.15.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.15.0...v2.15.1) (2026-10-07)


### Bug Fixes

* **mesh:** traceAlphaOutline scans the filled silhouette for a diagonal pinch, so a corner between two holes no longer refuses a part, and a hole is background no 8-connected path reaches, so a pinch on the outline is still refused ([#1210](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1210)) ([5a82114](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5a821146f5929dc1b015f3681c00b0b79c5c3b00)), closes [#1209](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1209)

## [2.15.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.14.1...v2.15.0) (2026-10-06)


### Features

* **validate:** an ik over more than two bones, or over a pair whose second bone is not the first's child, is refused by name — by the rig-spec parser and as a clause of A47 ([#1208](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1208)) ([936c1e1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/936c1e16484c598c99f998f40984c9900203d6c9)), closes [#1205](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1205)


### Bug Fixes

* **tools:** editor_roundtrip reads the editor's version under the trip's own -u and holds it against the export's skeleton.spine, failing by name when they disagree ([#1206](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1206)) ([65cbab3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/65cbab3eccd8a711d7381882f15a6087f599085c)), closes [#1199](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1199)

## [2.14.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.14.0...v2.14.1) (2026-10-06)


### Performance Improvements

* **core:** A10's walk assembles only what it scans — no getter readings, oracle bone rows, UV/triangle or vertex copies; three cuts of 6–9 % of A10 each, core-entry build −5.0 % (installed −3.4 to −5.6 %), peak memory up to −25 %, bytes unmoved ([#1203](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1203)) ([d28f4d9](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d28f4d9a1d12eb7f06474c2622924914048a55ed))

## [2.14.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.13.3...v2.14.0) (2026-10-06)


### Features

* **validate:** A23 names a rotate, shearX or scaleX physics constraint on a zero-length bone, one sentence per reading; gallery/look's whip gets its measured length, 66 ([#1200](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1200)) ([39fb4b6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/39fb4b66f93ccc4f3d65e92f2c9e681a88e8fdcb)), closes [#1195](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1195)


### Bug Fixes

* **validate:** A41 is retired: the Spine editor drops a physics constraint's rotate, scaleX and shearX only on a zero-length bone, at export (4.3.23, 4.3.26), which A23 now refuses; the editorRoundTrip declaration goes with it ([#1202](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1202)) ([60f4154](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/60f41541d18e67d2a1aa0df329264d9d28d32b02)), closes [#1196](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1196)

## [2.13.3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.13.2...v2.13.3) (2026-10-06)


### Bug Fixes

* **selftest:** TY40 is a SKIP stating both figures, never a FAIL, when the driver reads the plant below what its unit wrote; reproduced on macOS under an 8–16 GB sibling: 6 of 46 plants read 610–1,217 MB holding 1,397 ([#1197](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1197)) ([7159809](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/71598091cc292d7dfa18521b3ae3061f435212b3)), closes [#1185](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1185)

## [2.13.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.13.1...v2.13.2) (2026-10-06)


### Performance Improvements

* **render:** the core poser's render holds one framing set, one pose and one UV and triangle array per drawn part at a time; peak 3,981 to 1,809 MiB on the worst production rig, every frame identical, wall time unmoved ([#1193](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1193)) ([db4de90](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/db4de90376ab7c13977873a286d1c5318e33ed6e)), closes [#1180](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1180)

## [2.13.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.13.0...v2.13.1) (2026-10-05)


### Bug Fixes

* **smoke:** the rename-symbol plant renames loadPosable, which no shipped module imports, and is alone — on main its rename of headerBoxNumber killed --version, both builds, render and skills while the case read one step ([#1189](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1189)) ([7568718](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/7568718372ed0afccd55a4a0dbea4e77852b1a34)), closes [#1184](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1184)


### Performance Improvements

* **core:** A10's walk re-poses only the moved bones' subtrees, keeps each view's ordering plan, reads setup modes once and cuts no clipped row; core-entry build on 14 production rigs 1.78x to 1.46x the round trip, bytes unmoved ([#1191](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1191)) ([950af35](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/950af352cfe9f518ca4e996f9beb14b81f629ed9)), closes [#1179](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1179)

## [2.13.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.12.0...v2.13.0) (2026-10-05)


### Features

* **selftest:** each suite's children are held under that suite's own figure × 1.5, which no run moves — a figure is added once or moved by --reset-children-base — so the hand-committed ratchet goes and TY40 names core at +56 %, packer at +53 % ([#1187](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1187)) ([b9cd02e](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b9cd02eb27bd6ba60955fe563fd1026f6e0db29f)), closes [#1166](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1166)


### Bug Fixes

* **authoring:** the core entry's two parse rules, A00_MODEL_READ and A00_MODEL_REGIONS_ON_PAGES, get their §5.2 rows; CUR118 holds every code either entry's build prints to one row, and each count sentence says why that report totals 53 ([#1188](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1188)) ([223f285](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/223f2853000404d019aaa378af916e7adcb18f2f)), closes [#1183](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1183)
* **selftest:** an argument no reader claims is refused by name, exit 2, before the sweep or the temp root — one HARNESS_FLAGS table the readers answer to, --help prints it and exits 0, TY45 holds it and CONTRIBUTING lists it ([#1182](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1182)) ([2580b20](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/2580b206dc74483e655de89b58a0419d7c9538fc)), closes [#1174](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1174)
* **smoke:** a core-entry build that fails is SMOKE_CORE_ENTRY_BUILDS rather than a HOLE, held byte for byte to the round-tripped build, with two plants; CUR117 holds RELEASING's core-entry row to the command table ([#1181](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1181)) ([f657d83](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/f657d83938eaec586524c5018e43baf170d0b591)), closes [#1178](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1178)

## [2.12.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.11.1...v2.12.0) (2026-10-05)


### Features

* **cli:** rigc repack &lt;build&gt; --out &lt;dir&gt; — repack a build from its own output under build --pack's flags, written only after every region, the skeleton (or --accept-skeleton-differences, every path named) and the gate hold; --stage-box passthrough ([#1177](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1177)) ([554bb90](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/554bb907b9f7501f92d8bc05d860d66de55e9f75))
* **emit:** a rig can carry its stage in the shipped Spine files as a bounding box (`skeleton.stageBox`), held by A50_STAGE_BOX_IS_THE_STAGE on both suppliers and read back by `ingest --stage-box`; the 2.2.0 migration note joins the tree ([#1175](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1175)) ([5a81e7b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5a81e7b33f59dbd09c2392ad38089ff258863421)), closes [#1168](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1168)

## [2.11.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.11.0...v2.11.1) (2026-10-05)


### Performance Improvements

* **pack:** a footprint pass splits each placed cell's bands over the free-list entries near the cell — the free polygon pack on three production rigs goes from 10.7–41.8 s to 3.4–10.6 s, every page byte-identical, and the docs state where the cost starts ([#1172](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1172)) ([846b3af](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/846b3afcf894ba8fdf037248f9d4104a9e65ff2e)), closes [#1165](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1165)

## [2.11.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.10.1...v2.11.0) (2026-10-05)


### Features

* **package:** name spine-rigc/render, /png and /compile, hold every observed symbol from the install, and state the release notes' byte-identity sentence as a rule ([#1170](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1170)) ([6867ae7](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6867ae71c5305fd0631e7c871df188da34e83a00)), closes [#1167](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1167) [#859](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/859)

## [2.10.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.10.0...v2.10.1) (2026-10-04)


### Bug Fixes

* **tools:** a tool that made its own work directory removes it when its command ends, unless --keep-work, through one helper that EH08 and RH09 hold on every exit path ([#1164](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1164)) ([a2d86cb](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a2d86cbe35700b11c85a0d5effd634bfc9745afe))
* **tools:** hull_ceiling counts a region a conversion cannot make as its rectangle, not its silhouette — a page with no alpha no longer reads as a saving of its whole area ([#1162](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1162)) ([5e09793](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5e097939fb5e6605b85081f87a6d7e6bffc5fbd2)), closes [#1157](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1157)

## [2.10.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.9.0...v2.10.0) (2026-10-04)


### Features

* **selftest:** every run removes the rigc-selftest- roots that killed runs left once nothing has touched them for 24 h, claiming each by rename so concurrent sweepers never collide, and TY44 holds what it removes and what it must not ([#1160](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1160)) ([985d538](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/985d5380472b68e8f4d0ecb9944a1e75439d9bd8))


### Performance Improvements

* **core:** the core poser's excess over spine-core, accounted cause by cause with paired runs, and ten substitutions that change no byte (−38.5 %, 6.79x → 4.31x) ([#1159](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1159)) ([2ca93ab](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/2ca93ab4190dff67fe037b3c7e198a227f8265c2)), closes [#1134](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1134)

## [2.9.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.8.0...v2.9.0) (2026-10-04)


### Features

* **selftest:** both writers of the children's memory base keep the larger of the tracked figure and the run's and say which, --reset-children-base is the one spelling that lowers it, and TY43 holds every case with a plant each way ([#1153](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1153)) ([05c0405](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/05c04058d40ebef6712482afd9cfebc659d14d2a)), closes [#1151](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1151)

## [2.8.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.7.0...v2.8.0) (2026-10-04)


### Features

* **selftest:** a green merge writes the children's half of its platform's memory base with --memory-base-children, CI's test job writes it and uploads it as selftest-memory-base, and TY41 holds the write to the max over the shard documents and a red merge to none ([#1149](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1149)) ([342ae0c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/342ae0c5f89fd488104a91840abd0d18fc7ba596)), closes [#1144](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1144)

## [2.7.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.6.1...v2.7.0) (2026-10-04)


### Features

* **selftest:** every --unit child's peak RSS reaches the parent in its result, the suite line names its children's high-water and the unit that set it, and TY40 holds that figure under a per-platform base — with the scale read through Bun.spawn by ([#1148](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1148)) ([bcf7777](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/bcf777717f86aa51f2d4b88da035d621673bde24))
* **selftest:** every --unit child's peak RSS reaches the parent in its result, the suite line names its children's high-water and the unit that set it, and TY40 holds that figure under a per-platform base ([#1145](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1145)) ([af9af3f](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/af9af3fc24ac158b0ed20b1431dac672205070d3))

## [2.6.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.6.0...v2.6.1) (2026-10-04)


### Bug Fixes

* **selftest:** every directory a selftest process makes lives in one rigc-selftest- root that its exit removes, so a run leaves tmpdir() as it found it, and TY39 counts it ([#1141](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1141)) ([cec559d](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/cec559df6ece104aa01b63db515b1c8c898ea9ab)), closes [#1137](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1137)

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0) (2026-10-04)


### Features

* **selftest:** core's posing-heavy controls run as --unit work shared by --jobs workers, each control's lines and shares applied at its own position, so the log is byte-identical at any --jobs ([#1136](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1136)) ([8ea177d](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/8ea177d8aa82509b69026b248e67eecf9eb11b89)), closes [#1133](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1133)

## [2.5.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1) (2026-10-03)


### Bug Fixes

* **selftest:** builds of a fixture or probe land inside its own directory, so no page name spells a temp directory and VF09 counts the same builds in any process ([#1131](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1131)) ([cf1b125](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/cf1b125a96c887dad4b3b976ac14b75aa9abce44)), closes [#1127](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1127)

## [2.5.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.4.0...v2.5.0) (2026-10-03)


### Features

* **selftest:** a suite's independent units run up to --jobs at once with the log byte-identical, and shards are dealt longest-first from a tracked durations base ([#1129](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1129)) ([d7aef3c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d7aef3ca1e07dd0d0e1c2b0db8268a11b75597cb))

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0) (2026-10-03)


### Features

* **selftest:** the full run as n shards whose merge is the verdict — `--shard i/n` + `--tally-out`, `--merge` replaying the run off the shards' documents, and CI as six shards and a merge ([#1125](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1125)) ([557e879](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/557e8799544d9b779c5bf8f399206c683b9dfa24)), closes [#1116](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1116)

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0) (2026-10-03)


### Features

* **selftest:** each suite states its time and the process RSS after it, and the run ends with the ten heaviest suites by time and by RSS growth ([#1122](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1122)) ([b951c86](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b951c868db35626e89779f1e197192adae2162a8)), closes [#1116](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1116)


### Bug Fixes

* **selftest:** the full run's memory — heap and external beside RSS per suite, the three controls that set the high-water cut to a fraction of their peak, and the final RSS held under a tracked per-platform base ([#1124](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1124)) ([1c36d4d](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/1c36d4d60ce6b93a378abb651673c047dbba44a4))

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.1.3...v2.2.0) (2026-10-03)

> ⚠️ **Behaviour change — added 2026-10-05 (#1168).** Up to 2.1.3, `skeleton.json`'s header `x` / `y` / `width` / `height` held the rig's **stage** (the authored canvas, for example `0, 0, 832, 1216`). From this release they hold the **setup-pose bounding box**, as the Spine format defines them. Every build's bytes moved, and a consumer that scaled or placed a figure by reading those four fields as the stage gets a different size and offset — with no error from rigc or from a runtime. **Migration:** read the stage from the rig spec, or from `skeleton.model.json`'s `stage` beside the build; the Spine files themselves no longer state it (#1168 tracks giving them a place for it). This entry is listed under *Bug Fixes* because the header's earlier content contradicted the format; for a reader of the header as the stage it is a breaking change and should have said so here.
>
> Since #1168 a rig can carry its stage in the Spine files as well: `skeleton.stageBox` in the rig spec makes `build` write a bounding-box attachment whose four vertices are the stage's corners, which every runtime returns by slot and name (docs/AUTHORING.md §3.1, *For a consumer of the Spine files*), and `ingest --stage-box <slot>` reads it back.


### Features

* **tools:** `pack_anchor --trace-regions <tolerance>` packs every region-kind region by the contour rigc's tracer states for its art, converted in memory, at tolerance 0 and at the contour mesher — the stage-2 realised figure, measured before any attachment is converted ([#1118](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1118)) ([60f52a8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/60f52a88d50f1f48ca05eec64f34cfaffc439b41)), closes [#1115](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1115)


### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** the entry without spine-core prints the build's figures line with the full entry's keys, order and values — pages, regions, bones, slots, animations and the version read off the emitted pair, the attachment kinds, rig and profile off the model document — where it printed the constraint counts alone ([#1119](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1119)) ([8a2ed96](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/8a2ed96c7688cb6eac8e6e1a3dd00c515be597c0)), closes [#1114](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1114) [#1097](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1097)
* **emit:** the Spine header carries the setup-pose bounding box, computed by rigc's core and held to spine-core's getBounds at tolerance 0, and the stage stays the model document's ([#1117](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1117)) ([49bd779](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/49bd77981aff37bb0c7003815a289cd0f02689d8)), closes [#907](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/907)

## [2.1.3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.1.2...v2.1.3) (2026-10-03)


### Bug Fixes

* **tools:** the editor round trip reads the build's atlas and an `--exported` file before the editor starts, and refuses a missing atlas, an atlas that is a directory and an `--exported` file that is not one JSON object by name there — where it used to refuse the first only after the editor ran, and throw the other two as stacks at steps 3 and 4 ([#1112](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1112)) ([02a3813](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/02a38139cb88685cc7d93a70b0f9dd5d3be31267)), closes [#1107](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1107)

## [2.1.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.1.1...v2.1.2) (2026-10-03)


### Bug Fixes

* **atlas:** a `polygon` pack is the least total page area of three whole packs — `rect`'s, the owned-box anchor's, and one that may also put a cell's own corner where that anchor would leave the page — so a large region whose mesh draws a small part of it no longer forces the `rect` page, and no polygon pack is larger than `rect`'s on any set, a spill's pages included ([#1111](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1111)) ([3e889a2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/3e889a2a920e64e7058c45a0c9a4b321047fd6d4))
* **cli:** the entry without spine-core, refusing `validate` on a rigc build, says the build already ran its gate before it wrote — an export's refusal is unchanged ([#1109](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1109)) ([c87ef94](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c87ef94b8e65d5db89fda8afc40b103e865afa0e)), closes [#1097](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1097)
* **tools:** the editor round trip refuses a build whose `skeleton.json` is not one JSON object by its path and what it found there — not JSON, empty, a directory, `[]`, `null` — before the editor starts, where it used to throw a stack or start the editor on a file that is not a skeleton ([#1108](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1108)) ([ef2fbdb](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ef2fbdbe36afeb19f54ce7b11c31fcfa233f836a)), closes [#1090](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1090)

## [2.1.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) (2026-10-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **atlas:** a polygon page search stops a footprint pass at its first miss and prunes its free list by the edge a piece was cut along — a production-shaped page packs in 0.17 s where it took 304 s, the same pages to the byte ([#1105](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1105)) ([58942b9](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/58942b9f71d6e4fb1b59e91286e7ec4aac2b2a10)), closes [#1102](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1102)

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.0.3...v2.1.0) (2026-10-02)


### Features

* **atlas:** `--pack-shape polygon` packs a mesh region by its emitted hull, so a neighbour may sit inside its rectangle where the hull is not — never a larger page than `rect`, every sampled texel its own, and the pack line ends in the shape ([#1101](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1101)) ([fb689f8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/fb689f8c655545764e79e0f949914ceea001444c))
* **gate:** A49_PACKED_FOOTPRINTS_DO_NOT_OVERLAP replaces A06's tiling clause — two regions on one page are refused where their rectangles overlap and what they draw does too (a mesh's hull, every other region's rectangle), so a --pack-shape polygon page whose rectangles overlap outside the hulls gates green under spine-html ([#1103](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1103)) ([a8d465c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a8d465cd9fc072cd980f55602b1b9652de027ca6)), closes [#1099](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1099)


### Instrument

* **tools:** `tools/hull_ceiling.ts` measures what polygon packing could save over a corpus — over the 19 public recipes the hulls cover 0.981 of the rectangle area when only meshes are hull-packed, 0.735 when region attachments are converted to traced contours, and 0.714 is the opaque-texel floor ([#1098](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1098)) ([2c42bd3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/2c42bd3eef19cda48344a9f9304aac1b65bac850))

## [2.0.3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.0.2...v2.0.3) (2026-10-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** a generated mesh's `kind` is the one that chose its builder, and `tsconfig.json` is full `strict` — measured at one error on the whole tree, which a dependant's strict tsc found first ([#1096](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1096)) ([6a51946](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6a51946b8eb3f02d694cc1183eb732541b61b003))
* **diff:** the value walk reads a transform's offsets and property map, a slider's property and `local`, and every colour's alpha and blue; `diff` compares a timeline's target, a key's names, an attachment's region, clipping end and linked source, a skin's members and the constraints' order ([#1094](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1094)) ([b3de394](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b3de394d6666e98e2b8c9ae4f15ce9b973096e73)), closes [#1084](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1084) [#1085](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1085)
* **tools:** a failed import or export quotes every line the editor printed except its one `Licensed to: <name> <<e-mail>>` line, which is replaced by a line saying it was withheld — the measured failure prints that line straight before its error ([#1091](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1091)) ([4f14d85](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/4f14d851d4b5a6d11f7a32763e3893bd73dd2dc1)), closes [#1082](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1082)

## [2.0.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.0.1...v2.0.2) (2026-10-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **diff:** `constraints.refs` compares every name a constraint resolves — a slider's animation and property, and a transform's property map — and its note names each constraint wired differently with both sides' names ([#1088](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1088)) ([61b5940](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/61b594024661f2a874235d8d56860ad243a08969)), closes [#1078](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1078)
* **gate:** a page whose IHDR states a dimension of 0, or whose image data does not decode, is named once by A06 in a sentence — every other reader refuses it by the same sentence instead of a grid ratio of 0.0000, a stack, or silence ([#1089](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1089)) ([6013a06](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6013a069f529547c25f010a40b9c0e2decc3b506)), closes [#1073](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1073) [#1074](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1074)
* **tools:** the round trip records the editor's version as its one `Spine <x.y.z>` line of `--version` and prints nothing else from that output — the tail it printed was the licensee's name and e-mail ([#1083](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1083)) ([ae12dd8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ae12dd83defb365a613d7f95720e5c776b8b2e50)), closes [#1077](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1077)


### Instrument

* **cli:** every sentence the entry without spine-core prints naming `cli.ts` names the install route too, and the seam's absent-side refusal ends on it ([#1087](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1087)) ([6f536b3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6f536b3947619431bae183be77c5330a8438cc47)), closes [#1079](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1079)

## [2.0.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) (2026-10-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** a sentence that sends its reader to the entry linking spine-core names both routes there — installed, the same `rigc` once the runtime is beside the package; from a clone, `bun cli.ts` ([#1081](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1081)) ([627ff8c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/627ff8ce384ae3460954752a23f3322ed798f37c)), closes [#1072](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1072)
* **compile:** a slider whose animation an editor import would move off its index is refused — the file lists array-index names first, and the editor re-sorts and keeps a slider by index ([#1080](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1080)) ([d6a3231](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d6a32319b2a9195884ed8c9470e5f6513fa68efc)), closes [#1040](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1040)
* **gate:** a page on disk that cannot be read as PNG is named once, by A06 — A19 SKIPs pointing at it instead of adding a second FAIL about the same file ([#1075](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1075)) ([a746e2d](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a746e2de37a851adef42886aa7b37cd186560950)), closes [#1064](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1064)

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.9.4...v2.0.0) (2026-10-02)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **package:** an install of this package no longer carries `@esotericsoftware/spine-core`. The installed `rigc` runs the entry that links nothing of the runtime: `render`, `check`, `explain`, `pose`, `chainfit`, `ingest`, `diff` and `skills` as before, and — once #1060 lands — `build`, gated by rigc's own validator rather than the spine-core round trip, which runs in this repository's CI over the corpus. `validate`, `bench`, `bonedist`, `preview` and `vote` need the runtime installed beside the package. A clone is unchanged.

### Features

* **cli:** one statement of a build on every command, and cli_core.ts build writes what cli.ts build writes, gated without spine-core ([#1069](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1069)) ([5f08bd8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5f08bd8c550528f28e6a4f509d67bbd037b99a0e)), closes [#1060](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1060) [#1046](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1046)
* **package:** spine-core becomes a devDependency — an install runs cli_core.ts, the launcher chooses the entry by whether the runtime resolves, and the shipped closure is held over `files` ([#1066](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1066)) ([a709310](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a709310d2ed8d5d03835e9d6ae56c8661d03d527))


### Bug Fixes

* **docs:** the documents say what the package links — spine-core is a development dependency, the published rigc links no Spine runtime, and the gate it runs is named ([#1070](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1070)) ([16bf9fa](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/16bf9fae11662924a4eece9ef555652111631c1d))

## [1.9.4](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.9.3...v1.9.4) (2026-10-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **gate:** a page file not on disk is named once, by A17 — A06 and A19 SKIP naming the pages they did not read instead of printing PASS over them ([#1067](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1067)) ([66f9ee6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/66f9ee6465c858a65c1ee6d6d2241021da9e2c0d)), closes [#1055](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1055)

## [1.9.3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.9.2...v1.9.3) (2026-10-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **core:** a document posed with no skin set is posed as the runtime poses it — skins and no default one, or a default skin naming skin-required members, are drawn by the core rather than refused ([#1056](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1056)) ([544c7ec](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/544c7ecca5baf2f52cf1355ce6b55ea83bb4a6d6)), closes [#1051](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1051)
* **core:** a slider applies the physics timelines of its animation — render and check drew a rigc build wrong where a slider keys wind or gravity on a constraint that updates after it ([#1058](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1058)) ([5a04755](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5a0475561114b587b0bd8e8e546e5a7941b0b4cc)), closes [#1049](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1049)
* **gate:** the bones an animation keys are read in the order the file keys them — an integer-like bone name is listed first, and the order of bone timelines is measured not to reach a pose across bones and to be the file's on one bone ([#1065](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1065)) ([6e1b32a](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6e1b32aef251068955416cee06868727008c952f)), closes [#1039](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1039)


### Instrument

* **cli:** an entry that links nothing of spine-core — render.ts keeps only what names the runtime, the Spine side registers into a seam, and the core commands run with the package absent ([#1059](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1059)) ([24e83cb](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/24e83cb4fc439993c09bdf8a44449307079e3396))
* **gate:** the model side reads its rig info and durations off the document, lists its rows in validate()'s order, states the meshes once, asks every fact family on one walk, and keeps the runtime's timeline names out of src/core ([#1062](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1062)) ([46267cd](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/46267cd857128262bd104983aea2b0dbb5440828))

## [1.9.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.9.1...v1.9.2) (2026-10-01)


### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** bonedist and bench --bones refuse a pair they cannot pose by name, a build moved away from its pages is refused naming the page, and a skeleton that is not JSON is refused naming the file ([#1047](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1047)) ([cafc03c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/cafc03cf6d6509c93fcfcb9623eae98dd8388b67)), closes [#1042](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1042)


### Instrument

* **gate:** A10 written once against the stepped poses, supplied by spine-core and by the core's own looping walk — which keeps a non-finite value in place and fires a physics reset across the wrap ([#1053](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1053)) ([2447536](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/2447536608e7f815178ee91b7b54cdcc18f8f640))
* **gate:** A40 and A34 written once against facts and supplied by either side — what a timeline does when applied additively is a computation the core now makes, held cell by cell to the runtime's probe ([#1050](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1050)) ([cbcfc96](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/cbcfc9665ea845813a83a59cf169ded54cc6cf0b))

## [1.9.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.9.0...v1.9.1) (2026-10-01)


### Bug Fixes

* **model:** every reader takes the file's order from one place — stated on a /3 document, derived on a /2 with integer-like names first — and the groups an animation keys by name are walked in the file's key order ([#1038](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1038)) ([4422ab6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/4422ab666c97f091a58dba45d2358ce12a5ad619)), closes [#1034](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1034)
* **render:** a directory whose files are not one build is refused by name — another build's skeleton.json or atlas no longer dies in the runtime with a stack trace ([#1041](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1041)) ([f609f9e](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/f609f9e8ce161b28884c0d60b7074c77d49e0359)), closes [#1033](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1033)


### Instrument

* **gate:** A09, A39, A43 and A46 written once against facts, supplied by spine-core and by the model with the core — each posed value asked of both suppliers at every time the bodies pose at ([#1045](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1045)) ([b47a113](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b47a113980af5e7180c2b82bf36ffdbe7818b7b1))
* **gate:** A12, A24, A25, A26, A29, A30 and A32's audio clause written once against facts and supplied by either side — the clauses that read only the Spine encoding stay with the round trip ([#1044](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1044)) ([178a645](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/178a6451b929fe1fba5033eaa200fedfc2906d3f))

## [1.9.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0) (2026-10-01)


### Features

* **model:** the model document states the stage, the file's orders and each page's pma and scale (rigc-compiled/3), and compileModel yields the model without calling the Spine emitter ([#1037](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1037)) ([03b6d2a](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/03b6d2ac31457b9d7dd1ca568c90b4797f5e4927)), closes [#1026](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1026)

## [1.8.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0) (2026-10-01)


### Features

* **explain:** a rigc build is explained without executing spine-core — the deform survey reads its structure from the model document, and --poser says which reader ([#1027](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1027)) ([53bfdb9](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/53bfdb9a917ecbd2e42a16eebcecff9285361e78)), closes [#1019](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1019)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** meshes and regions are bound with the runtime's arithmetic — a bound point poses where it was authored, to the float32 floor ([#1031](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1031)) ([caee5ab](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/caee5ab5e755ffcd7c1b1de2e0641ba6b0a3d4d8)), closes [#1021](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1021)
* **render:** a rigc build is rendered and checked with its skeleton.atlas gone — page placement and page names are read from the model document ([#1029](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1029)) ([b2b83ed](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b2b83edd97d20db28511e98193b6e2c0c9c2ae17)), closes [#1020](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1020)

## [1.7.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.6.2...v1.7.0) (2026-10-01)


### Features

* **model:** the model document carries each region's place on its page — the core draws a build without reading the atlas ([#1022](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1022)) ([a6db791](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a6db79170cc0cb3dabf86ba96e8dc1e2ec65fe7f))


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** the routines that said they transcribed a runtime routine call the core's measured form — every emitted byte unchanged ([#1023](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1023)) ([94c8a35](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/94c8a35a8cc5fb5865da6e00d1d337d45c8e9124)), closes [#1015](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1015)
* **guide:** what spine-core does for a rigc command, as run — a build is posed by the core, an export and the round trip by spine-core ([#1017](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1017)) ([73037ba](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/73037ba55bc36a5d85633b966093574e7611ac7d)), closes [#1013](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1013)
* **render:** a rigc build is rendered and checked without executing spine-core — the runtime is used for an export, --poser spine and the round trip ([#1024](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1024)) ([8cbec66](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/8cbec66ed64d105eda68269c43a5ad486b910ef6))

## [1.6.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.6.1...v1.6.2) (2026-09-30)


### Bug Fixes

* **render:** the framing box is over the slots that pose — a drawn slot on a bone the skin leaves unposed no longer pulls the frame to the origin ([#1010](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1010)) ([96ce427](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/96ce427590761d2c812ffc4ecc12c50ecb3cbd53)), closes [#1000](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1000)


### Instrument

* **selftest:** RG02 compares every seed over the reference length — a seed drawn fewer than 4,096 times no longer reads as a disagreement ([#1009](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1009)) ([d435eed](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d435eed10295ecfbddb3b904a8a3fb9e56bcaddc)), closes [#998](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/998)
* **selftest:** the core suite names an absent corpus as a HOLE, as every corpus suite does — a run with no examples/ exits as CONTRIBUTING says ([#1007](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1007)) ([c1991b5](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c1991b5a80f323133500fc36eac8dfad657dbf49)), closes [#1004](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1004)

## [1.6.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.6.0...v1.6.1) (2026-09-30)


### Bug Fixes

* **release:** the publish gate runs the selftest over the example corpus, as CI does — the core suite's corpus controls are red without it ([#1005](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1005)) ([5423dff](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5423dff810a52a0ae6dabf6db05ea229871e029d)), closes [#1003](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1003)

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.5.3...v1.6.0) (2026-09-30)


### Features

* **check:** check poses the candidate through rigc's core when the input carries a model document — the poser named in the report; verdicts and reports byte-identical to the spine-core check on every gallery row ([#987](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/987)) ([5c4c145](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5c4c145903697583d17803e34bc1556845e21314))

* **compile:** CompileResult carries the compiled model — its first record, bones, built as ModelBone and emitted as SpineBone by the Spine emitter, byte-identical on every recipe ([#918](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/918)) ([1717561](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/17175611450977a01c4392bdb73ec0eb2db5177f)), closes [#915](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/915)
* **compile:** every region record and sequence frame carries its atlas rectangle — trim and original size from the build's one atlas source — so the compiled model poses without the atlas; the Spine bytes unchanged ([#939](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/939)) ([5c245eb](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5c245eb1704359502aea163c86601717def46563)), closes [#935](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/935)
* **compile:** the animations as model records — the Spine animations object assembled by the emitter with its group order, omissions, the editor's name order and refusal, the every-global physics name and the ik flags on keys, byte-identical on every recipe ([#924](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/924)) ([9092b03](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/9092b0343f8e8b53fa6a0837c4ba767872f66a41)), closes [#921](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/921)
* **compile:** the compiled model written beside the Spine files as rigc-compiled/1, A18 extended to it, emitSkeleton as the emitter's one entry, and compile.ts held free of every Spine shape by a control — the Spine bytes unchanged on every recipe ([#927](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/927)) ([e6c85e6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e6c85e650dc93202db460371fab697bda268fe8b))
* **compile:** the remaining records — slots, region and linked-mesh attachments, skins, constraints and events as model records, the transition union gone, every remaining spelling, order and omission the Spine emitter's, byte-identical on every recipe ([#923](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/923)) ([db3d850](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/db3d850351bc8722979d2cbf12d1a79c428ee5ad)), closes [#919](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/919)
* **compile:** the weighted run by name — mesh, path, bounding-box and clipping attachments as model records whose bindings name their bone, encoded to indexes by the Spine emitter, byte-identical on every recipe ([#920](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/920)) ([f27d2f3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/f27d2f359bf907657d1342753e3dde21cd03f4e1)), closes [#917](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/917)
* **core:** atlas page and page UVs from rigc's own atlas reader, measured against the runtime's uv arrays at tolerance 0 on every corpus — the draw's last input the core lacked ([#974](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/974)) ([5e0643a](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5e0643a2fb53b758c5672fcc70a06cc583d79802))
* **core:** concave and inverse clips drawn through the core — the rasteriser samples each clipped triangle at its source triangle's affine UV, so the render is decomposition-invariant and pixel-identical to spine-core on every probe ([#982](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/982)) ([7f14687](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/7f1468790d82c13869de1fd57e12de25fd64f846)), closes [#964](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/964)

* **core:** construct 4, remainder — deform, sequence, draw-order and event timelines at a sample time, measured against spine-core; the laterTimelines HOLE replaced by per-kind census and the last public SKIP judged ([#962](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/962)) ([4b898fb](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/4b898fb07d4d31f38eef2a65b03537a894c79651))

* **core:** construct 5, fourth cut — the stepped physics phase: reset and update at a fixed dt, every parameter and flag and the physics timelines measured against spine-core; the rows declaring physics admitted under the step ([#963](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/963)) ([959800f](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/959800fb6c91e3607fae5b8357ef3e9e2e04567b))

* **core:** construct 5, third cut — physics under Physics.none and the slider constraint at the setup pose and at a sample time, measured against spine-core; every constrained row but the path rig admitted on the blocks it can pose ([#953](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/953)) ([557c101](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/557c101315f032988d24f0d98e7e37713858790d))
* **core:** construct 6 — clipping applied to the draw, the triangles after a strictly convex clip as the runtime's clipper produces them, measured against spine-core; concave and inverse clips left out by name ([#971](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/971)) ([c520543](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c520543e872050e71da1f3520c836d1160114493))
* **core:** rigc's own core reads rigc-compiled/1 and poses every bone's setup pose under the five inherit modes with an evaluator of its own, measured against spine-core — dumped as pose-oracle/1 and identical on every recipe without a constraint; the harness every construct is admitted through ([#929](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/929)) ([64de839](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/64de839ca32867d1ff122157f163fca8cd775029)), closes [#925](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/925)
* **core:** the equivalence gate poses per skin — --skin &lt;name&gt; on both dumpers, every skin of a row declaring several judged, the merged view kept for rosters; the ambiguous-placeholder SKIP retired ([#973](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/973)) ([7c5a216](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/7c5a216ac906dacbc4e683b6225c9360a4150343))

### Bug Fixes

* **core:** a constraint on a bone the posed skin leaves unposed reads and writes as the runtime does — signed zeros included, no NaN; a value that depends on the runtime's previous pass is classified by measurement and refused by name where it reaches a posed bone ([#983](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/983)) ([0733b11](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/0733b1127116b913a070c23c9e7e411b4f2c72f4)), closes [#979](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/979)

* **deform:** turnCeiling picks the minimum-angle triangle on the r6 grid with an index tie-break — a pow ulp no longer moves the document ([#990](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/990)) ([566f6e7](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/566f6e78058c6538722a5ce9eb364a8c7425bbf0)), closes [#949](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/949)
* **model:** the depth ceiling report is on the r6 grid like every measured figure, and every number the document spells is held to the f32 or r6 grid — the one machine-dependent value the Linux artifact confirmed ([#942](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/942)) ([#950](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/950)) ([31ffcaf](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/31ffcaff1ff028911d93ef1c1ae057a75e367690))
* **oracle:** the stepped schedule crosses a physics reset key once, as a player does — both dumpers and the raw walk ([#985](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/985)) ([c481eec](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c481eec7539adf53c7d735b858a980d3299b825a)), closes [#960](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/960)
* **render:** a pose whose every drawable sits on an inactive bone is refused by name — no 0×0 frame is written ([#1002](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/1002)) ([536e212](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/536e2121313a2494530a0aeb63bcf1d25464a49e)), closes [#997](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/997)
* **render:** the guide's --poser row lists the fallback reasons the render prints, held to them by RC09; a model document the core cannot read is named once ([#999](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/999)) ([108c9ad](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/108c9ad4e206ae44f5ef0c33624c70d61e4b7c00)), closes [#996](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/996)
* **rig:** a slot's blend is refused by name when the runtime would read no mode — only the first letter's case is free, as for the constraint enums ([#970](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/970)) ([1bb6584](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/1bb65842f5bfd0a61419099490311464ce2c41d2))


### Instrument

* **selftest:** --only &lt;suite&gt; runs a squad's own suite and exits 2 naming every suite it skipped — a partial run that cannot read as green ([#944](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/944)) ([a811aa5](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a811aa5993ecee48486046dcad9b0a6a469f755c)), closes [#937](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/937) [#380](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/380)
* **selftest:** the random populations draw from a generator whose period exceeds every population; MG07 retired with the measurement ([#994](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/994)) ([efd00c3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/efd00c3f56f46e9b5231a2a4d3dfca33e478e85f)), closes [#952](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/952) [#940](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/940)
* **tools:** a tracked base hash document for the gallery rows — the five base-gate controls hold byte identity on every run, and a stale base is red with the one command that refreshes it ([#941](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/941)) ([0d1b899](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/0d1b89956145e8746155061c559048b1cebe9bae))
* **tools:** emit_hashes — every build in every corpus hashed across commits, the byte-identity instrument step 1 of [#380](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/380) is gated by ([#916](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/916)) ([c05311b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c05311b9550a687def8dde2cac26bfd9ff6c8917)), closes [#914](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/914)
* **tools:** pose_oracle — the exam's pose oracle in the tree, with world vertices, draw order, clipping, events and stepped physics, in a JSON a second dumper can produce ([#911](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/911)) ([d3ad1f8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d3ad1f872e24c173ce85de95f36da16c8284ee6e))
* **tools:** pose-oracle carries the slot's blend mode — the core judged on it on every recipe ([#947](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/947)) ([3d135a6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/3d135a66ba0bf45d7334d8a9f5f07f48bf4d21f7)), closes [#933](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/933)

## [1.5.3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.5.2...v1.5.3) (2026-09-28)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** every enum key of the spec has an owner — boneIndexing, from.rotation, a generator kind and the manifest's mesh.kind outside their sets are refused naming the value and the set, where 5 or "foo" built green or crashed ([#906](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/906)) ([eb5fdd8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/eb5fdd8a72c91cd86f33fe66dbb7c846aaeb62db)), closes [#900](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/900)
* **validate:** A10 reads the setup pose of a skeleton with no animation and skips only the stepping half — a static rig posed to NaN is refused where it gated green ([#905](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/905)) ([86e615f](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/86e615fff111273bd28af37fd8930e6e7fd3d6a6)), closes [#902](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/902)


### Documentation

* **motion:** §6.4 keys the flag's extreme 27 % after the arm's, as §3.7's table says, and the chain is regenerated; §7 says what a picture measures ([#903](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/903)) ([82d0fab](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/82d0fab37381d76179c2cc62edff7b6497aef9c3)), closes [#897](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/897)

## [1.5.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.5.1...v1.5.2) (2026-09-28)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** a spec value of the wrong type is refused naming the field, the type found and the type required — "x": "5" no longer builds as 5, and every key the scan admits has a type ([#901](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/901)) ([babe62e](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/babe62e9a6780750a9f766a3468c03e16e1b8779))


### Instrument

* **pose:** the trace records each coarse seed's rotation row — a half-turn within 2.4 px of the truth on 2 of 238 found trials and none of the 6 misses, so the one-rotation field stays and both levers measured are rejected ([#896](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/896)) ([52faeba](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/52faebae6346483ef9477ee53607b8a499fe21e5))


### Documentation

* **motion:** §6 derives the flag hinge in the arm bone's own frame — flag.x 24.66 → 47.93, frame 0 matches poseA within 0.4 px — and the chain, the digests and the argument are regenerated on the current search ([#899](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/899)) ([4431011](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/4431011de58b3c2ef5532d580a7cb16c7bf5990e)), closes [#885](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/885)

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.5.0...v1.5.1) (2026-09-28)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** a number the skeleton cannot carry is refused naming the field and the value — a bone at x: 1e309 (or 1e308) no longer builds green as "x": null ([#891](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/891)) ([3df097b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/3df097b088baa493755cc68f77a5c771784e416e))
* **pose:** the stopped polish also tries a quarter rung up — the narrowed search on MOTION §6's stationary post returns to the old placement (0.0649 → 0.0593, 0.1 px from it), the floor grid finds 237 → 238, misses 8 → 6 ([#893](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/893)) ([e3e50e9](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e3e50e9aa3c213e2765c1be9d34f60ed585ecf1a)), closes [#886](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/886)
* **validate:** A10 reads the whole world transform — a NaN in a, b, c or d is refused naming the bone, the frame and the term, where a finite position let it through ([#888](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/888)) ([66ad971](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/66ad97170415a33fda0cddb65449ea49bf9571fb))


### Instrument

* **docs:** the docs-quote suite counts a transcript no anchor rule reaches, anchors a report header, runs a tagged setup fence in an overlay, and matches a token-leading `…/` — the five pose blocks reproduce ([#895](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/895)) ([ea34c44](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ea34c44ac8ac381869557b1e633e73bbc5da7f8c))

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.4.0...v1.5.0) (2026-09-28)


### Features

* **atlas:** build --pack --page-edges free searches every width, with two exact bounds — twelve region sets measured, up to 10.22 % smaller pages at 53 ms for all twelve ([#879](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/879)) ([012a751](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/012a7510c621c691eab422c7cec4b195c05d8ac8))


### Bug Fixes

* **pose:** the polish escapes a scale–position valley by re-fitting half a rung up and the refinement carries 15 — the four trials [#876](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/876) lost return at their truth, the floor grid finds 227 → 237, misses 14 → 8 ([#884](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/884)) ([7a9aa4b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/7a9aa4bb793cc0e1386227b75ffda7f8e7f4eed6))
* **render:** a pose that is not finite is refused by the bone or vertex that overflowed and its value — "posed no drawable attachment" stays for a skeleton that draws nothing ([#883](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/883)) ([120d87c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/120d87c420bc97439262c9b24ddc8da594c5bf49)), closes [#873](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/873)

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0) (2026-09-28)


### Features

* **render:** --geometry writes every frame's skinned vertices and bone world transforms beside the frames — the instrument spine-parts' stretch and head-frame judgements need ([#874](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/874)) ([570fdf3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/570fdf330c41c1a38152ec56a235aa33c07e2c0e)), closes [#864](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/864)


### Bug Fixes

* **pose:** the coarse grid steps at an eighth of the part, not a quarter — 42 more trials found on the floor grid (185 → 227 of 420), the 48 px fist places at its truth, search misses 65 → 14 ([#876](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/876)) ([85bcaed](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/85bcaed56618d8a34a79b6a7c6a2d91cc07e2303))

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.2.3...v1.3.0) (2026-09-27)


### Features

* **atlas:** build --pack can size the page freely — two painting rigs measured 37–47 % smaller at the PK05 bound; rotation measured and held back ([#870](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/870)) ([8bc2da6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/8bc2da6c7afc50aefdc4a12ae87beaeba271e41c))
* **compile:** a "segments" mesh generator — lattice over the part's alpha, weights from distance to named bone segments, one authoring decision ([#868](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/868)) ([922becc](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/922beccfd2913979e74e56eff04819d62c8e8de5))
* **package:** an exports map names the surface a dependant may import — plate, font5x7, transform, cli — and keeps deep paths for one release ([#863](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/863)) ([ced7cc5](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ced7cc52050b4dfadc80d0eb0fc785b1f293351a))
* **validate:** A15 reads invariants.idleDrivesMeshes — a painting rig declares that its idle deforms meshes and A15 reports the cost instead of 42 refusals ([#867](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/867)) ([3b99bcb](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/3b99bcb9662c36028fd4e532fb2780343665ed65))


### Bug Fixes

* **pose:** a refusal names the part's size, texture and candidate spread against a measured floor ([#869](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/869)) ([7fd796c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/7fd796cd843aae9a50aef77521f0cadd4c258a1d))
* **smoke:** the release confirmation waits for the tarball, not the packument — metadata without bytes is "not served", exit 3 ([#861](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/861)) ([fcabe4d](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/fcabe4d3fb0ea7de6c4183feda4ba86b4e90bd41)), closes [#833](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/833)

## [1.2.3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.2.2...v1.2.3) (2026-09-27)


### Documentation

* **readme:** lead with the words users search for — AI-authored Spine 2D rigging and animation, verified before it is written ([#853](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/853)) ([d257c86](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d257c868fc0446501c58ddddd379b66d41f3001d))

## [1.2.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.2.1...v1.2.2) (2026-09-26)


### Documentation

* **cases:** a case study — converting a Live2D model to Spine with the tree alone, and verifying the conversion ([#852](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/852)) ([4079398](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/4079398b7d07427565ed0c2e96169d81f09cc2a8))
* **skills:** the loop reads check from the top and treats a figure as a start, and the foreign-player paragraph says where a drawable's part goes ([#850](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/850)) ([ee24851](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ee24851efbb9300bddf1e0179b82b706dddaa7fd))

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.1) (2026-09-25)


### Bug Fixes

* **check:** a sidecar-less frame set that is not opaque is refused by name, the no-frames.json note names both origins, and an unmatched directory names the animations and --as ([#845](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/845)) ([5a66b03](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/5a66b03563bdd1c79c6bd1b3efd81772b88e96ce))
* **render:** the rasteriser clips as the runtime does, so render and check no longer draw pixels a clipping attachment removes ([#847](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/847)) ([282880b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/282880bf7c6cce64f4405e2599f51a85c8a73870))

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0) (2026-09-25)


### Features

* **check:** `--out` writes the picture each listed frame's figures came from — reference, candidate, difference and overlay at native size ([#840](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/840)) ([e2abb95](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e2abb95264fd08d62a42ad486f2c065752d912ee))
* **preview:** the header carries the line `validate <dir>` prints, a page takes a pane per candidate, and a green build ends by naming it ([#843](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/843)) ([be2e251](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/be2e2512a90fac6fec7870ef14abab3c4f0ba9b4))
* **render:** `--slot` and `--hide` draw a subset of the slots on the whole rig's grid, recorded in frames.json and refused by `check` as a reference ([#838](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/838)) ([f84eae4](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/f84eae4f3f8955a7d0c44ab2b2f77074ffd70dd3))


### Documentation

* **skills:** the entry skill says what to look for after `render`, where reference frames come from for a foreign player, and that a unit ends on `preview` ([#841](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/841)) ([c8cb0bc](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c8cb0bc085e4d7e7eca5daf7bcadd006c815f887))

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.0.2...v1.1.0) (2026-09-24)


### Features

* **cli:** `rigc skills install` puts the shipped skills where Codex, Gemini CLI and Antigravity look, and every guide reference survives a per-folder install ([#832](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/832)) ([4fdf650](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/4fdf650da2d638f29527ef57c1e509aa327905b3))


### Instrument

* **selftest:** `CUR110` and the tree-text scans read what git tracks, not what sits in the directory ([#829](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/829)) ([27b7de0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/27b7de0230542ad9f47ebb8bbad8e956e35e4af3))

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2) (2026-09-24)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** split SPEC_COVERAGE into the format reference and a dated survey, and stop the point refusal citing parts that moved ([#826](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/826)) ([6d4185a](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6d4185a3255955faf1eabd7e3a9170f4e733f8db))
* **validate:** A02 names the generations that spelled `transform` — 4.0 and 4.1, not 4.2 ([#819](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/819)) ([889684c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/889684c71fb6acdc62d077559506a396c8d3c225))
* **validate:** A07 names a trailing blank line as that, not as a page block with no region ([#820](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/820)) ([109c1f6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/109c1f664bb50cf7cff470edd71ea363edd09252))


### Documentation

* **authoring:** §0–§2 and §5–§12 speak in the present tense, without the tracker, the controls or the runs behind them ([#822](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/822)) ([0e18c4d](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/0e18c4d04840085ee733bfb6f5392553e9a2f1cf))

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1) (2026-09-23)


### Documentation

* **generations:** the Spine-generation policy as one page, and a README paragraph that was a diary entry removed ([#813](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/813)) ([c1e3185](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c1e318535511cabe282c5e92e786dbae0c1d8673))

## [0.36.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.36.0...v0.36.1) (2026-09-23)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** `--atlas-in` re-emits a pack in rigc's own blank-line shape, and `A07` names a leading blank line as that rather than as "consecutive blank lines" ([#809](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/809)) ([bc74395](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/bc7439566b00f81186996cf6f7979f66f1e10ced))
* **compile:** a `default` skin is emitted exactly when the spec has one, so a rebuild of an export with no default skin declares none either ([#801](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/801)) ([#805](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/805)) ([9c85d84](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/9c85d841aa03ac2fffef978c329cee14e8f3dde5))
* **compile:** a stated path `lengths` is carried as stated, and an omitted one is measured through the runtime's own bone matrices at the parser's `vertexCount / 3` entries ([#808](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/808)) ([f01c6d6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/f01c6d6a5ada6bbfad96115231291bf95e78431e))


### Instrument

* **timelines:** each physics bound states its basis, arithmetic or behavioural, and a control holds every one against the runtime ([#807](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/807)) ([dedb4c7](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/dedb4c7f309ffdbac06b12a913b33f06718a115e))

## [0.36.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.35.1...v0.36.0) (2026-09-23)


### Features

* **compile:** an attachment states its own `name` in the rig spec, written verbatim and never composed, so a rebuild answers to the names its export does ([#802](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/802)) ([6d0c86a](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6d0c86a67387277cf362e50de82b09c5b01513b7))


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** a sequence whose frames differ in size builds at the size it states, because the runtime draws every frame into the attachment's one size ([#797](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/797)) ([ef698f5](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ef698f5bb23c450986c6f59673668e99e7727a66))
* **timelines:** physics `damping` is bounded on the closed `[0, 1]`, so a setup or keyed 1 (4.2's own default) and a 0 build, and only the values past either end are refused ([#800](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/800)) ([11bc29f](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/11bc29f08bd991df6e68770e3b8a39983250c2ba))

## [0.35.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.35.0...v0.35.1) (2026-09-23)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** a mesh writes its `path` and `color` right after `type`, and a skin's slot keys are compared with U+3000 and the full-width digits folded, so the two production shapes the public exports never carry come out in the editor's order ([#792](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/792)) ([bb2dd64](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/bb2dd648d9bb428fbd3a15be8389597ec19cf4b3))

## [0.35.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.34.0...v0.35.0) (2026-09-23)


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** a contour's margin and tolerance are the drawing's pixels on a `scale:` page, applied as the stated scale's worth of texels, so a finer page traces the declared outline and its refusals say what was applied ([#789](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/789)) ([ab1c31b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ab1c31b50cd25f85831b4e596254ec5bfe63636a))
* **compile:** every emitted object's keys come out in the order the editor writes them, from one table read off the twelve editor exports ([#785](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/785)) ([d48c505](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d48c505afc1e3f5e99f45a3c46c9100b33837347))
* **compile:** every key an editor export leaves to the 4.3 parser is left out of the file, so a rebuild is its export apart from hash and spine ([#790](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/790)) ([afdf428](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/afdf428fae7fbbaaea2caf190361400a5c54a096))
* **validate:** `A19` decides a loose part's transparency by its texels, so a fully opaque RGBA overlay is refused loose as it is packed ([#788](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/788)) ([c9ab386](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c9ab386a903da633149ed00b79c69d96dcdf9b53))
* **validate:** a muted ik or transform the rig spec declares consumer-driven SKIPs by name at A47/A48, and ingest writes that declaration for the shape an export cannot explain ([#787](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/787)) ([6a159e3](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6a159e3bd83c499be1a3b8abb0c5314c8e1108bc))

## [0.34.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.33.1...v0.34.0) (2026-09-23)


### Bug Fixes

* **chainfit:** the hinge ladder divides its window, so the step `search` prints, each part's `window` and each chain note are the step the run walked ([#780](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/780)) ([ba4be02](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ba4be02c5d33864295dccd72d4c1fd3e01c4fa0d))
* **compile:** a mesh fit's overshoot is stated in the drawing's pixels on a `scale:` page, and a depth sheet or soft mask made at the art's size is read there by the ratio the atlas states ([#778](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/778)) ([c668c66](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c668c66aacd65770e0055be0decd0188083ad94f))
* **compile:** every emitted number is its float32's shortest name, so an editor export's rebuild spells every number as the export does ([#782](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/782)) ([b00228a](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b00228ae0a62020b22fd0172ffd1fc01b15bfe3f))
* **pose:** an accepted placement that stopped on a wall of the search window names the wall beside the value it holds, and `walls` records it for every verdict ([#781](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/781)) ([c58e498](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c58e49892a7d58ba9a1f0dec563088260a6c5907))
* **validate:** `A19` exempts the base plate the rig names before it measures one against the stage, so a stageless manifest rig's pack gates green and a stageless rig-spec build says what would decide its plate ([#775](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/775)) ([9572726](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/9572726ff9964776db0bbea14a4a0c35acc77778))


### Miscellaneous Chores

* **release:** ship the float32 number formatting as 0.34.0, not a patch ([#783](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/783)) ([dcb8a9b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/dcb8a9be9618f5a371ce1a4ab5a6bacfc364b42d))

## [0.33.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.33.0...v0.33.1) (2026-09-23)


### Bug Fixes

* **validate:** `A45`, `A43` and `A46` pose a key at the time spine-core stores it rather than one float step before it, so the selftest's own `ingest_probe` is green and `IG72` holds it there ([#771](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/771)) ([#772](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/772)) ([d62d8e2](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d62d8e24bfc0dacc30fbe7e8840ed4002f66e2e2))
* **validate:** `A47`/`A48` ask the muted-at-rest question of an ik and a transform constraint, live by the runtime's own `!== 0` and, for a transform, on the mixes of the properties it drives ([#774](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/774)) ([0e12588](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/0e125881ecbde490cfaa1cf95d999047e8094b92))

## [0.33.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.32.0...v0.33.0) (2026-09-23)


### Features

* **ingest:** a skeleton that declares no stage is carried by `ingest` as declaring none, and every reader of the stage says what it does without one ([#714](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/714)) ([#768](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/768)) ([565a3f8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/565a3f8d7912e4ead30eae92b993b92ba7a3de66))

## [0.32.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.31.0...v0.32.0) (2026-09-23)


### Features

* **compile:** a sequence attachment draws a numbered image series resolved frame by frame by name, a `sequence` track steps it, `A46` poses every key against the file's own statement, and `ingest` carries both instead of blocking ([#729](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/729)) ([#767](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/767)) ([a1dc6fb](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a1dc6fbc17ad3bbef169efd9b919e51a41ccf43e))


### Bug Fixes

* **ingest:** a contested attachment whose source name is not the one rigc composes is reported under `ATTACHMENT_NAME` with both strings, read off `composeSkinAttachmentName` rather than a second copy of the separator ([#746](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/746)) ([#763](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/763)) ([40dfa29](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/40dfa2954d4c31e7eb009b3421bedde8bbd51994))
* **validate:** `A36`/`A37` read the `mix` values a timeline poses, through the one reading `A23` now shares, and `A23`'s setup sentence says a negative `strength` is pushed away while `damping`'s refusal names its `fps` dependence ([#752](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/752), [#748](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/748)) ([#766](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/766)) ([641456c](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/641456c84312ea6a5437c09b630aa63515a22a1a))

## [0.31.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.30.0...v0.31.0) (2026-09-23)


### Features

* **compile:** a bone's `inherit` mode is keyable — the motion spec gains a stepped `inherit` track, `ingest` carries it, and `A10` names a key the runtime resolves to no mode ([#733](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/733)) ([#760](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/760)) ([63b75ef](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/63b75efcf3cb6776eb52cce6f68d990f6c44f435))


### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** `explain` and `build` withhold the figures they would take off a page that is not its declared size, and a contour there is refused with `A06`'s sentence ([#750](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/750)) ([#761](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/761)) ([f5fbf43](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/f5fbf433ca7f66e3b0a510ed2cacab62b5550793))
* **ingest:** the physics timeline that names no constraint is spelled `"physics": "*"`, emitted under the empty name, read by `A34` as every constraint declaring that property global, and carried by `ingest` byte for byte ([#726](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/726)) ([#758](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/758)) ([9a6661e](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/9a6661e887b7750748d9548f2b753a6359c0174b))

## [0.30.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.29.0...v0.30.0) (2026-09-23)


### Features

* **compile:** the separable slot colour timelines `rgb`, `alpha` and `rgb2` are spelled, emitted as themselves and read back — and `ingest` carries them instead of blocking ([#730](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/730)) ([#757](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/757)) ([4d6d427](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/4d6d4276335ad854f72654bcef80bc5d80b36b0d))


### Bug Fixes

* **ingest:** a physics constraint that drives no component is omitted with its timelines and skin membership, and named by a coded LOSS, so the rebuild of a file an editor exports is no longer refused whole by `A23` ([#731](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/731)) ([#754](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/754)) ([96d7c2b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/96d7c2b02d8ac354f0e64a830a295a32d3f562c6))
* **validate:** an atlas page that is not a PNG is refused by name — one signature reader names WebP, JPEG, GIF, KTX, KTX2 or the bytes it found, and says truncated for a PNG that runs out before IEND ([#732](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/732)) ([#756](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/756)) ([c21854b](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/c21854b93337735fffde949f71358354b6c740a6))

## [0.29.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.28.0...v0.29.0) (2026-09-19)


### Features

* **compile:** a skin's `bones` and its constraint lists are per-skin sets, so two skins may activate one bone ([#725](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/725)) ([#741](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/741)) ([4c85f87](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/4c85f87db0c317234a7dc07273775ee37b392437))


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** a physics `strength` key of 0 is a span the next key undoes, so a KEY is held to `>= 0` where a setup pose stays `> 0` ([#727](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/727)) ([#749](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/749)) ([8141634](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/81416340723ff46b35a328a3af41b817ba2965ee))
* **compile:** the editor's name order is read off five stored round trips rather than quantified over a family, so folders, capitals and accents build and only what those files leave open is refused ([#728](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/728)) ([#745](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/745)) ([d111e25](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d111e256715214c3f9ca3ab28aa61508df04ea93))
* **ingest:** a dropped attachment `name` is the atlas region key, so it is kept as `path` — on a contested placeholder too, where nothing was said at all ([#742](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/742)) ([#747](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/747)) ([8aa3296](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/8aa3296a43a606bed8869b3b5bd5a3c47d28c002))
* **validate:** a physics constraint muted at rest is refused only when no timeline keys its `mix` above 0 ([#743](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/743)) ([#753](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/753)) ([a610488](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a6104884e194bc9f482eabbf1dd9e81e27d13dcd))


### Instrument

* **validate:** the page-size clause names the ratio it measured and the `scale:` header that states the same art truthfully, and `A19` stops judging texels it cannot locate ([#715](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/715)) ([#751](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/751)) ([99f9156](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/99f91569c4d7e689eafe566d747b1e7f0c5ec254))

## [0.28.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.27.0...v0.28.0) (2026-09-19)


### Features

* **diff:** animations get a name-agnostic block and an `--as` bridge, so a candidate that named its own shot can be measured ([#720](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/720)) ([#736](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/736)) ([0593c7f](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/0593c7f1c5f7ab45895769d86a7b00b03dec9691))


### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** a turned atlas region's page rectangle is printed where an author reads it, and §0.2 says which way to turn it ([#718](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/718)) ([#739](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/739)) ([aaaf866](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/aaaf866fbaecf1ac76bdc6e46601782a6a04bd9b))
* **docs:** §3.4 documents the three attachment types that carry geometry and no art, and says which corner a mesh's `uvs` start from ([#717](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/717)) ([#734](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/734)) ([bf609ee](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/bf609ee3d952823a00a93cb9c66b33a2d6e8cfe2))
* **pose:** a refusal that stopped on a wall of the search window names the wall, and the rotation ladder the report prints is the one it walked ([#719](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/719)) ([#740](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/740)) ([6b4ae47](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6b4ae47ed2b99f869d46fc3601a7b051b30599ea))

## [0.27.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.26.0...v0.27.0) (2026-09-19)


### Features

* **ingest:** a file from another Spine generation is named, with what a 4.3 reader loses counted on that file ([#706](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/706)) ([#721](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/721)) ([ce233a0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ce233a0a64a96c09b67f3cdf508b4af22a5fd518))


### Instrument

* **validate:** `A19` counts the texels it read, so a rectangle it could not read is a named non-measurement and not a verdict ([#705](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/705)) ([#723](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/723)) ([dad641e](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/dad641e94d409c3d5792640624cea441e2e39cae))
* **validate:** a foreign linked mesh that states its own geometry is refused by name, and `ingest` says what it dropped ([#710](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/710)) ([#724](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/724)) ([294eab8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/294eab881614999263bc4877cafc647155f4f2e6))

## [0.26.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.25.6...v0.26.0) (2026-09-18)


### Features

* **compile:** a deform key may target a `path` attachment, and the constraint follows the curve the key wrote ([#696](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/696)) ([#709](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/709)) ([a19ad53](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/a19ad53f339ec8404fd3c338d7c9010949e3a7c8))
* **compile:** a linked mesh draws another mesh's geometry, resolved by name, and every silence the parser keeps about one is refused ([#691](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/691)) ([#713](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/713)) ([e7a4381](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e7a4381f385d1afc5a209b5b19604670e6cca17f))
* **compile:** a slot's dark colour moves — `rgba2` is spelled, emitted, read back off the runtime and drawn ([#690](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/690)) ([#712](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/712)) ([41cfb15](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/41cfb15d389c89586e6253a0a3b12266afd72308))


### Bug Fixes

* **compile:** a constraint name is unique per kind, the way Spine resolves one, and a spec rigc's own parser refuses is a coded ingest finding ([#692](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/692)) ([#711](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/711)) ([dc59f55](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/dc59f55ceb068de8b6b878c7031d058c90f05994))

* **validate:** a region's rectangle lies inside the page it names, under every profile ([#694](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/694)) ([#707](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/707)) ([20061b0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/20061b019e0c3e086c508e22f6f9e87967eb96ef))

## [0.25.6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.25.5...v0.25.6) (2026-09-18)


### Bug Fixes

* **check:** a slot's drift is correlated only over the pixels that reach the picture, and every figure carries the bound its own match gives it ([#698](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/698)) ([#704](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/704)) ([aa976a6](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/aa976a65c1f0f7eab74068404fe16f477b85778f))

## [0.25.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.24.0...v0.25.0) (2026-09-17)


### Features

* **diff:** the corpus round trip compares the values inside the structure, with the format's defaults read off the parser ([#615](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/615)) ([#628](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/628)) ([898b251](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/898b251716e09eebafb932fc6dc3358dc8d51dff))


### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** `--stage` is for a skeleton that declares none, not for editor exports as a class, and the help text is held to the corpus that refuted it ([#616](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/616)) ([#627](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/627)) ([d2306d1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/d2306d1970aab7593656c3efb9fbc17abcb73e58))
* **diff:** an omitted `x`/`y` inside a declared stage is the `0` it means, so a rigc build and its own editor export stop reading the same box as half moved ([#620](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/620)) ([#623](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/623)) ([6018caa](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/6018caaf887234dd7ba12c4f9561c3aca681deaf))

### Instrument

* **docs:** the gallery READMEs quote the run's own closing lines instead of hand-kept assertion counts, and the overrides comment states its criterion ([#609](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/609), [#605](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/605)) ([#614](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/614)) ([e38daac](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e38daac1ff1a4c0abcbb1a5b17c9e6cb3e93eae8))
* **ingest:** the IG suite gates all twelve editor exports through ingest, rebuild and diff, so the corpus round trip is a measurement the tree holds rather than one a pull request body remembered ([#594](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/594)) ([#618](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/618)) ([0abd7eb](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/0abd7eb5afb9a5cd993b8a906b1ef2af75954433))

## [0.20.1](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.20.0...v0.20.1) (2026-09-11)

⚠️ **Read the generated section below last.** `release-please` builds it from commit
**type**, so `test:`, `docs:` and `ci:` commits never appear in it. In this release that
is **23 of 24 commits**, and it is all of the work. What follows is the whole cut.

### What this release is about

**The guides an agent authors from stopped saying things the tool contradicts, and the
gates that would have caught them got built.**

`docs/AUTHORING.md` is a first-class deliverable rather than documentation — it and the
validator's messages together are the only interface an agent that cannot see the rig
actually has. It ships in the package. So do `docs/FACE.md`, `docs/INGEST.md` and four
more. This cut changed about 270 lines across three of them, and every change is a
correction rather than an addition.

### What an installer gets that is different

- **Five figures the tool contradicts, and two it never printed at all** (#468). One of
  the two was `26 PASS, 13 SKIP` — rigc prints no tally line, so that was authored
  arithmetic inside a fence, indistinguishable on the page from output. Another was
  `14 excluded`, which could not be checked against any line the tool emits. For those
  the repair was deletion: when nothing holds a number, removing it *is* the fix.
- **A worked script that demonstrated something other than what its prose claimed**
  (#471, #472). `docs/FACE.md` §9.2 read a deform by list position, assuming `i % 5` was
  the column — and a commit had **renumbered the vertex list**, not the triangulation, so
  the script stayed green for a week while showing a different pair. Repaired to read the
  rig by coordinate, it reproduces the documented pair **byte-exactly**, and §9.3 —
  which the same script feeds and which nobody had run — now gives the table's own
  `0.20 / 0.38` instead of `0.33 / 0.61`.
- **A transcript nobody could rerun, now saying what it is** (#441), and **two blocks a
  reader could not otherwise check, now stating the command that produces them** (#485).
- **Three counts in the measure register that do not close** (#490), each retired for a
  different reason: one measurable but unreachable by any criterion (nine were tried),
  one not re-measurable at all because the re-read was never written to disk, and one
  derivable off the table printed directly above it. ⚠️ The third was wrong twice — the
  count *and* the characterisation. Five rigs read short, not four, and **none of the
  five is a size disagreement**: the smaller rig's sizes are wholly contained in the
  larger's, so what the shortfall names is a region one rig has and the other has not.
- **A count in a `src/diff.ts` comment** that nothing derived, struck rather than
  refreshed.

### The gap that hid all of it

`docs` is the one hidden commit type that **still changes the package**. Seven guides
ship, so a correction to one of them changes what the registry serves under a type the
release machinery is told to ignore — and 23 commits accumulated with no release opening.
⛔ Un-hiding `docs` is not the repair: most of `docs/` does not ship, so every note to a
working document would open a release pull request and the type would stop meaning
anything. `RELEASING.md` now records what to do instead — **read what changed in the
`files` allowlist, not the commit types** — and a check that reads the same array
`npm pack --dry-run` reads is filed.

### Why you can trust the above: 577 → 593 controls

None of this ships, and it is the reason the shipped half is now checkable.

- **Gates over what the tree says about itself.** A doc-script suite that runs the
  scripts a page states (#477); a docs-transcript suite over what `docs/` quotes the tool
  as printing, with its coverage published beside it — verified, declared, unreachable
  and sealed, each with its reason (#468); a third anchor rule reaching fences that open
  on a section rule, whose first catch is the very block a hand pass had repaired (#489);
  and a control refusing a line-number citation anywhere in the tree, after nine stood in
  one file and **eight were wrong** (#487).
- **Details that stop lying on the run they exist for.** A control whose verdict is a
  conjunction of terms its detail does not read prints a clean sentence under a FAIL.
  Twenty-five sites repaired across four tranches, each measured before conversion and
  seven candidates correctly left alone. The helper that makes the shape hard to write is
  itself gated, because nothing else could see it break: with its guard removed the whole
  file runs **green**.
- **Plants tested by the fault they raise** rather than by the tree being quiet (#491).
  Fourteen red-first clauses asked whether *anything* faulted; a fault standing anywhere
  else satisfied them, so each stopped testing its plant on exactly the run it exists for.
- **A comparison form that cannot be written unmarked** (#506). Two sweeps found the same
  defect by matching on what a clause looks like and both under-counted, so the answer was
  not to find every site but to make the bare form a **type error**.

### The mistake in this cut, and its repair

One landing **silently reverted an earlier one** — three controls and two repairs
disappeared and the run stayed green, because a derived tally reports the smaller number
just as honestly as the larger. It was found three landings later. ⇒ CI now refuses a
change that removes a control without naming it, with the permission travelling in the
same diff so no allow-list exists; replayed over history it refuses the landing that
removed three and accepts the one that removed one and said so.


### Bug Fixes

* ship the guide corrections that landed under a type the release machinery hides ([#515](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/515)) ([ae29869](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/ae29869051b21ff9b02b58524e077cdca16cf019))

## [0.20.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.19.0...v0.20.0) (2026-09-10)

⚠️ **Read the two generated sections below last.** `release-please` builds them from
commit **type**, so `test:` and `docs:` commits never appear in them. In this release
that is **nine of fourteen commits**, and it is where most of the work is. What follows
is the whole cut.

### What this release is about

Two things that turn out to be one: **the tool learned to say what it is not measuring,
and the repository stopped making claims about itself that nothing derives.**

**The depth report says what the sheet is *not*** (#448, #449). `sampleMeshDepth` refused
a sheet that did not cover the mesh — but the check sat behind *"does this sheet have a
transparent texel anywhere"*, so a **full-frame opaque render skipped it entirely**, which
is exactly what monocular depth estimation produces. The same defect was a named refusal
in one encoding and a green build in the other; the counts from both sides agree at **56
of 81** on the fixture that proves it. It now **reports rather than refuses** — a
full-frame sheet is a legitimate statement and rigc has no authority to guess an input
away — and what it adds is a measurement: how many of a mesh's vertices sample a texel the
part image does not draw.

**`stepShare` separates a form from a discontinuity.** A form's share halves under lattice
refinement while its ceiling converges; a cliff pins its share and halves its **ceiling**
instead, because there is no slope to converge to. Measured on synthetic sheets: form
0.358 → 0.100 with the angle steady, cliff 0.460 → 0.497 with the angle falling by half
each time. No threshold anywhere — the number is reported so an author can see which kind
of thing the ceiling read.

**A line came back from the dead** (#440). Giving the disputed dial the breadcrumb its
neighbours have exposed that the rollup identity was a literal at three sites, one of them
with a different separator — so `N span(s) between consecutive keys scanned` had printed
on **no rig at all** since #418. That line exists so *"the scan ran and found nothing"*
cannot be read as *"the scan never ran"*, and it had silently become the second.

**The run counts itself** (#439, #451, #453). The selftest's summary used to restate every
suite's size by hand. Wrapping the calls put a number on the drift for the first time:
**18 of 47 floor increments were wrong, the summed floor stood at 435 against a run of
551, and one suite had never been counted at all** — a floor 116 cases below the truth
being the only thing between a vacuous run and a green one. Every figure is read off the
lines each suite prints now, and **no hand-written number is left anywhere the summary
reads from**, which made buildable a check twice rejected as unbuildable: a numeric
constant whose only reader is the summary is refused by name. ⇒ **Adding a control needs
no summary edit**, measured twice on the day it landed by two independent changes.

**Two silences in the toolchain, closed** (#457, #465). A `.gitignore` entry ending in a
slash covers **one of the four things a path can be** — a symlink, a file and an absent
path all slip past — and three paths here had already turned out to be symlinks, showing
as untracked in a public tree. All 31 entries are slashless, and `CUR10` plants each path
in a throwaway repository as a directory, as a symlink and as a file and asks git each
time. Separately, two raw NUL bytes made `cli.ts` binary to the grep an agent has, so a
search over the file that owns the report text matched nothing, silently, with the same
exit code as an absence — it had already produced a wrong conclusion.

**Doctrine** (#445, #446, #447). **rigc compiles an object; the scene belongs to the
consumer.** The code had never crossed that line and the prose had — including a caption
claiming "scene direction" over a film whose own text states the boundary correctly and
measures it at **0 differing pixels across every hand-off**. The honest claim is the
stronger one: the rig guarantees the seams, and the composing is the consumer's.
[ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) is new.

The selftest carries **577** named controls at this tag.

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/compare/v0.16.0...v0.17.0) (2026-09-05)

**A part can state its own depth, and rigc will tell you how far it turns.**

Until now a 2.5D turn read one radius shared by a whole column of vertices — a
cylinder standing in for a surface. A generator can now name a **depth map**, and
`yaw`/`pitch` read a `z` per vertex off it. The lattice that carries those
vertices is **generated** rather than hand-numbered. A **painted mask** says
which region is soft, so a `physics` constraint answers an impact over exactly
that area. And `build` and `explain` now print the **turn ceiling**: the largest
angle this geometry on this sheet takes before a triangle reverses, per axis and
per direction, naming the triangle that goes first.

That last one changes the loop. The angle was previously found by writing a key,
building, reading `A39`'s refusal and guessing again; it is closed form —
`tan t = A₀/A_axis` — and the compiler now says it up front.

### Features

* **deform:** a depth map gives every vertex its own z, and yaw/pitch read it ([#383](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/383)) ([e0371e8](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e0371e899feb279dd46c8348ddaa74845bdb62d0)), closes [#382](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/382)
* **mesh:** a `grid` generator, so the lattice stops being hand-numbered ([#386](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/386)) ([b0ec75a](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/b0ec75a8e24cbf2f11754874fa498a79846e5574)), closes [#382](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/382)
* **depth:** a painted mask marks a soft region, and a physics constraint on its bone answers an impact over it ([#390](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/390), [#391](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/391)) ([843aad4](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/843aad49fd44d54a0b000851df9301ea4955ac08))
* **depth:** report the turn a sheet supports, before a key is written ([#393](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/393)) ([cc79286](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/cc7928635673795e98c1089f83fa8e35543555a0))
* **docs:** `FACE.md` §2.2 and `AUTHORING.md` §3.4 — the fold angle belongs to the depth map's steepest slope, not to the mesh density ([#392](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/392)) ([e409077](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/e409077))

### The one rule to read before using any of it

**The angle a part can turn through is a property of its depth map, not of how
finely it is meshed** — approximately `1 / max|dz/du|`, the reciprocal of the
sheet's steepest slope. Refining a lattice does not lower the ceiling; it finds
slopes that were always there. A map that reaches its floor with a *vertical*
edge — a dome, a hemisphere, anything traced straight off a rendered normal —
folds at any angle you like once it is meshed finely enough, while a map whose
slope is bounded holds the same angle at every density. Measured over a 1,300×
range of vertex counts: 62° → 14° for the first, a steady 63–64° for the second.

So a ceiling you cannot live with is fixed by editing the **sheet**, not the
mesh. rigc will not flatten a map for you; a depth map is a measurement, and the
compiler never invents a value that is not in the spec.

### What this release does not do

* **None of it has met real art.** Every figure quoted for the depth work was
  measured on generated fixtures — analytic ramps, domes and checkerboard blobs.
* **The angle and the jiggle cannot ride one attachment yet.** A mesh carried by
  a soft-region bone has two influences on some vertices, and a `transform` key
  needs one bind space, so per part it is one or the other
  ([#389](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/389)).
* **A dense mesh is a large file.** 449 bytes per vertex, plus ~1.77 MB per
  deform key at 32,761 vertices. The gate itself stays linear and green to
  64,800 triangles; the artifact is what grows.

### Bug Fixes

* ignore scratch as a path, not only as a directory ([#385](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/385)) ([87bb21f](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/commit/87bb21febd6ce80086d34e97ac0413abc093f771)) — repository housekeeping, no effect on the published package

### Withdrawn inside this release

Two commits in the log add things that **do not exist in 0.17.0**. They were
built and taken back out before release, and are listed here only so a reader of
the commit history is not left looking for them:

* `parallax` as a deform kind ([#388](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/388), removed in [#391](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/391)) — it was a `yaw` with a term dropped, and baking a pointer-driven value into time keys is a category error. Parallax is camera work and belongs to whatever draws the result.
* a soft region chosen by a **depth threshold** ([#390](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/390), replaced in [#391](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/391)) — softness is not prominence. The most prominent thing on a face is the nose, and a nose does not wobble. The region is painted now.
