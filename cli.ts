/**
 * rigc — the rig compiler.
 *
 *   bun cli.ts build --rig <path> --motion <path> --out <dir> [--manifest <path>]
 *   bun cli.ts build --cut <name> --cuts <cuts.json>
 *   bun cli.ts explain --rig <path> --motion <path> --out <dir>
 *   bun cli.ts explain --cut <name> --cuts <cuts.json>
 *   bun cli.ts validate <dir>            re-run the gate on artifacts on disk
 *   bun cli.ts check --candidate <dir> --frames <dir>   compare against pictures
 *
 * `build` emits ONLY if validate is green. That ordering is the point: the
 * compiler is allowed to be wrong, it is not allowed to leave the wrong thing
 * on disk.
 *
 * ⚠️ Green is a claim about VALIDITY and about nothing else. The gate has no way
 * to know whether the animation is the one that was asked for — a build with
 * every easing reversed passes it — so `check` is the other half of the loop, and
 * it is a separate command because it needs something the gate does not have: a
 * picture of what the result is supposed to look like.
 *
 * rigc knows nothing about any particular project. A cut is a rig spec, a motion
 * spec and an output directory — plus a cut manifest when there is measured art
 * behind it — and a `cuts.json` is a named table of them:
 *
 *   {
 *     "my_cut": { "rig": "…/rigs/my_rig.rig.json", "motion": "…/my.motion.json",
 *                 "out": "…/spine", "manifest": "…/manifest.json" }
 *   }
 *
 * Its paths resolve against the cuts.json file itself, so the table travels
 * with the project that owns the art rather than with this repository.
