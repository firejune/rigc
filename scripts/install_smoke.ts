/**
 * Does the PUBLISHED PACKAGE build a rig on a machine that has never seen this
 * repository?
 *
 *     bun run smoke                      the whole battery, on this tree's tarball
 *     bun run smoke -- --case clean      just the green one
 *     bun run smoke -- --source registry --version 0.21.0
 *
 * Four exit codes, because a caller has to be able to tell the outcomes apart
 * without reading prose: **0** every case passed, **1** a case went red —
 * against `--source registry`, the published artifact does not build — **2**
 * nothing ran at all, and **3** the registry never served the version inside
 * `--wait`, which says nothing about the package. See *The wait* below.
 *
 * Nothing else in this repository asks that question. `prepublishOnly` gates the
 * SOURCE TREE, the `ships` job in `ci.yml` reads packed PATH LISTS, `CUR16` reads
 * the relative imports of shipped modules, and `release.yml` publishes and never
 * installs. Each of those is a fact about a list; this is the fact about a
 * program — `npm pack`, `npm install` into an empty directory, and a real build:
 * compile, the round trip through `spine-core`, and files on disk.
 *
 * 🔒 **Nothing under this repository is on the fixture's path at run time.** The
 * rig spec, the motion spec and the plate generator below are authored as text
 * into the install directory, and the generator imports `spine-rigc/tools/plate.ts`
 * as a BARE specifier, so it resolves inside the install or not at all —
 * `SMOKE_FIXTURE_CAME_FROM_THE_PACKAGE` prints the path it resolved to and
 * refuses one that is not under the install. The only thing that crosses from the
 * checkout is the tarball this script packed out of it, which is the subject.
 *
 * 🌱 **The plants are part of the tool, not a story in a pull request.** A smoke
 * that has never been seen to fail proves that a program ran, not that a program
 * was checked, so every case but the first two rebuilds the tarball from a
 * PATCHED COPY of the extracted package — an allowlist entry removed, a module
 * removed, a dependency added back, the skills removed, the `exports` map
 * removed, its deep paths removed, a named entry removed (one plant per entry
 * since #1212), one observed symbol renamed, the parser's error class forked
 * from the one its entry exports, the core entry's build made to refuse, one byte of that build's
 * output moved — and INVERTS the verdict: such a case is green only when the smoke
 * went red at the step it was supposed to, naming what went missing. The worktree is never patched; the patch is applied to the extraction
 * and packed from there, and a plant that removed nothing is itself a fault.
 *
 * ## The wait, and the two outcomes it separates (issue #563)
 *
 * ⏳ A publish returns before the registry serves what it published, and npm
 * says so on the way out: *"Your package is being processed and may take a few
 * minutes to become available."* That notice is the only statement of the
 * window anybody has, and it has no upper bound in it, so `--wait <minutes>`
 * keeps asking — 5 s, 10 s, 20 s, then every 30 s — and prints how long it has
 * been asking. The default is 15 minutes against three cuts measured between a
 * publish step returning and the version entering the registry's own packument
 * (`time[version]`): 4 min 11 s, 2 min 07 s and 2 min 38 s, all on 2026-09-16.
 * RELEASING.md carries those figures and their sources.
 *
 * 📦 **"Served" means the bytes, not the metadata** (issue #833). The packument
 * answering is the first half: v1.1.0's packument answered 2 min 38 s into the
 * wait and the tarball behind it was still a 404, so the first `npm pack` of
 * the battery failed and the run printed *the published artifact does not
 * build* over a package a dispatch confirmed green six minutes later. So each
 * attempt, once `npm view <spec> dist.tarball` answers, runs the fetch itself —
 * `npm pack <spec>`, the same command a case would run, through the same npm
 * configuration and cache — and the wait ends only when that has written a
 * non-empty tarball. The cases install **those bytes**, copied, rather than
 * fetching again, so "the fetch the smoke is about to make" and "the fetch the
 * wait saw succeed" are one fetch and there is no second one to race. Every
 * attempt line says which of the two pieces is still missing.
 *
 * 🚨 **Not-yet-served and served-and-broken are different facts and they do not
 * print the same red.** A version the registry has not finished processing says
 * nothing at all about the package: that is exit **3** and a message saying the
 * confirmation was not taken. Only a case going red on an artifact the registry
 * did serve is exit **1** and *the published artifact does not build*. The first
 * real run of the confirmation step went red on a cut that was fine, because a
 * 60-second wait ended in `npm view`'s raw `E404` and nothing said which of the
 * two had happened.
 *
 * What it cannot see, stated so nothing reads more into a green run than is
 * there: it does not run the published artifact unless `--source registry` asks
 * it to (the tarball this tree packs is not the tarball npm serves until a
 * publish makes it one), it says nothing about how the rig LOOKS — `rigc check`
 * is that instrument — and it is one platform's answer, the runner's. Both
 * halves of the probe are `--prefer-online` — npm caches a packument, a
 * negative answer included, and a poll reading its own earlier 404 back would
 * wait out the whole ceiling on a package that had already arrived.
 *
 * ## Why `scripts/` and not `tools/`
 *
 * It does not ship: it runs from a checkout, in CI and from `bun run smoke`, and
 * `scripts/fetch-examples.sh` is the standing example of exactly that. Both
 * directories are inside `bun run typecheck` — `tsconfig.json`'s `include` names
 * every `.ts` under `scripts/` as well as under `tools/` — and inside `bun run
 * lint`, so neither placement escapes a gate. But `tools/` is inside one more,
 * and being inside it is a cost rather than a benefit: `CUR18` asks whether every
 * declared spec key is named by code somewhere outside its own declaration, and
 * its population is `cli.ts`, `src/` and `tools/`. This file embeds a rig spec
 * and a motion spec, so measured against that population it names **56 of the
 * 182 declared keys** for a reason that has nothing to do with anything reading
 * them. Under `tools/` it would dilute a gate by a third of its subject; under
 * `scripts/` it is read by no gate whose population it can weaken.

const HELP = `rigc install smoke — does the published package build a rig in an empty directory?

usage:
  bun run smoke                          every case below, on a tarball packed from this tree
  bun run smoke -- --case clean          one case by name
  bun run smoke -- --source registry --version 0.21.0
  bun run smoke -- --source registry --version 0.21.0 --wait 15
  bun run smoke -- --installer bun       install the tarball with \`bun add\` instead of \`npm install\`
  bun run smoke -- --keep                leave the install directories where they are

--wait <minutes> is for \`--source registry\` and nothing else: a publish returns
before the registry serves what it published, so this is how long to keep asking
before giving up. Default ${DEFAULT_WAIT_MINUTES}; \`--wait 0\` asks once and does not sleep.

exit codes:
  0  every case passed
  1  a case went red — against \`--source registry\`, the published artifact does not build
  2  no case ran, so this run measured nothing
  3  the registry did not serve the version — its packument, or the tarball behind it — within
     --wait, so the confirmation was NOT taken; nothing here says the package is broken

cases:
  clean          a correct package installs WITHOUT spine-core and its rigc runs the core entry, whose build has to exit 0 and write its files; with spine-core installed beside it the same rigc builds through the round trip, writing the same bytes as the core entry's build of the same fixture, resolves every \`exports\` entry and every shipped path, reads every observed symbol through its entry and calls the ones a dependant was seen calling; with spine-core taken away again it imports every observed entry as stated, renders and checks that build, links its skills, and the bin shim names Bun when bun is absent
  unusual-path   the same, installed at an absolute path with spaces and non-ASCII in it
  drop-plate     tools/plate.ts out of \`files\`  — the smoke has to go RED naming it
  drop-src-module  src/validate.ts out of the packed tree — the smoke has to go RED naming it
  add-dependency   @esotericsoftware/spine-core put back in \`dependencies\` — the install has to go RED naming it
  drop-core-entry  cli_core.ts out of \`files\` — the install's \`rigc --version\` has to go RED naming it
  drop-skills      \`skills\` out of \`files\` — \`rigc skills install\` has to go RED naming it
  drop-exports     \`exports\` out of package.json — importing spine-rigc/plate has to go RED naming it
  drop-deep-exports  \`exports\` cut to its named entries — the deep path spine-rigc/tools/plate.ts has to go RED naming it
  drop-named-entry   ${DROPPED_ENTRIES['drop-named-entry']} out of \`exports\` — importing spine-rigc${DROPPED_ENTRIES['drop-named-entry'].slice(1)} has to go RED naming it
  drop-rig-entry     ${DROPPED_ENTRIES['drop-rig-entry']} out of \`exports\` — importing spine-rigc${DROPPED_ENTRIES['drop-rig-entry'].slice(1)} has to go RED naming it, with the runtime and without it, and nothing else
  drop-mesh-entry    ${DROPPED_ENTRIES['drop-mesh-entry']} out of \`exports\` — importing spine-rigc${DROPPED_ENTRIES['drop-mesh-entry'].slice(1)} has to go RED naming it, with the runtime and without it, and nothing else
  drop-errors-entry  ${DROPPED_ENTRIES['drop-errors-entry']} out of \`exports\` — importing spine-rigc${DROPPED_ENTRIES['drop-errors-entry'].slice(1)} has to go RED naming it, with the runtime and without it, and nothing else
  rename-symbol      ${RENAME_PLANT.symbol} exported under another name — the symbol read through spine-rigc${RENAME_PLANT.entry.slice(1)} has to go RED naming both
  fork-compile-error ${FORK_ERROR_MODULE} given a CompileError of its own — the parser's refusal, caught by the class spine-rigc/errors exports, has to go RED alone naming both
  refuse-core-build  the core entry's build body made to refuse — the core-build step, and only it, has to go RED naming SMOKE_CORE_ENTRY_BUILDS
  move-core-byte     one byte appended to the atlas the core entry's build wrote — the comparison, and only it, has to go RED naming the file

A plant case is green when the smoke failed the way the plant says it must, and
red when the smoke passed anyway. Nothing is written inside the repository.
