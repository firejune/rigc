/**
 * The package under its second name: the same bytes as the tarball this tree
 * packs, with the `name` field of `package.json` changed and nothing else.
 *
 *     bun scripts/alias_tarball.ts pack --name <alias> --out <dir> [--tarball <tgz>]
 *     bun scripts/alias_tarball.ts compare <package.tgz> <alias.tgz>
 *
 * The package is published as `name` in `package.json` and, at every version,
 * as an alias carrying the same files (issue #1258): the unscoped short name is
 * refused by the registry, and the name the package first shipped under keeps
 * being served so nobody who depends on it is stranded. RELEASING.md
 * *Publishing* says which name is which and why.
 *
 * `pack` writes the alias tarball into `--out` and prints its path as the last
 * line of stdout, which is what `release.yml` hands to its second
 * `npm publish`. It packs this tree (or takes `--tarball`), extracts the
 * result, rewrites the one `"name": …` line of the extracted `package.json`,
 * packs the extraction again, and refuses to print a path unless `compare`
 * then reads the two tarballs as identical but for that line. Nothing is
 * written inside the repository: the tree the publish step and the
 * confirmation read is the tree that was gated.
 *
 * `compare` is the same reading on its own, for any two tarballs: the same set
 * of paths, every file byte-identical, and `package/package.json` identical
 * once the alias's `name` line is put back to the package's. It is what the
 * smoke's `--alias` runs on the two tarballs the registry served, so the
 * confirmation reads the published bytes rather than this tree's.
 *
 * ⚖️ **Not the tarball's hash.** The two tarballs cannot share a `dist.shasum`:
 * one line of one file differs by design, and gzip and tar headers differ with
 * it. What is promised is the unpacked content, so that is what is compared,
 * file by file, and a difference is named by path, both sizes and the first
 * byte at which they part.
 *
 * 🔒 **The alias publish runs no lifecycle script, and that is why it is sound
 * rather than a gap.** `npm publish <tarball>` runs none — `prepublishOnly`
 * exists only for a publish from a directory — and the gate cannot be run a
 * second time in a way that means anything: renaming the package in the
 * checked-out tree leaves it modified, which the tally reader refuses
 * (`TALLY_DIRTY`), so a second gated publish would run the whole selftest
 * again on a tree that is no longer the commit the gate ran at. The alias is
 * instead packed from that commit after its own gated publish, in the same
 * job, and `compare` holds it to that tarball before the path is printed.
 *
 * Exit codes: **0** the alias was written (`pack`) or the two tarballs carry
 * the same content but for the name (`compare`); **1** they do not, each
 * difference named; **2** a usage error, or a pack or an extraction that did
 * not complete, so nothing was measured.
 *
 * Not `tools/`: it does not ship, and it runs from a checkout — the same
 * reason `scripts/install_smoke.ts` lives here.
