/**
 * `rigc repack <build> --out <dir>` — a packed build repacked from its own
 * output, written only after the repack is shown to have lost nothing (issue
 * #1169).
 *
 * A consumer that keeps only `skeleton.json`, `skeleton.atlas` and the page
 * PNGs could not take up a packer improvement (`--page-edges free`,
 * `--pack-shape polygon`) without regenerating its parts upstream. The route
 * it measured by hand — cut each region off its page, `ingest --art loose`,
 * `build --pack` over the cut parts — is this command, in process and through
 * the tree's own functions: `liftAtlas` (`extractRegion` per region), `ingest`,
 * and `runBuild` with the entry's own gate, the body every `build` runs.
 *
 * 🔒 **Nothing reaches `--out` until three things have been shown**, and the
 * command prints each:
 *
 *   (a) every region lifted off the NEW pages is pixel-identical, by name, to
 *       the same region lifted off the input's pages (`regionDifferences`);
 *   (b) the rebuilt `skeleton.json` is byte-identical to the input's. A repack
 *       is entitled to change nothing in the skeleton: attachments name their
 *       regions and the atlas alone carries where a region sits, so the pack
 *       owns the atlas and the pages and none of the skeleton. Measured on the
 *       tree's recipes, every repack of a rigc build wrote the same bytes;
 *       a difference is refused naming the paths (`skeletonDifferences`);
 *   (c) the gate is green — `runBuild` returns only then, having gated the
 *       compile and the packed pair exactly as `build --pack` does.
 *
 * The build runs in a work directory of its own under `tmpdir()`
 * (`REPACK_WORK_PREFIX`), which also holds the lifted parts and the two specs;
 * the output is the build alone, the same four kinds of file `build --pack`
 * writes, so a repacked build can be repacked again. The directory is removed
 * when the command ends — green, refused, a gate that exits, or a throw —
 * from this function's `finally` and, for the `process.exit` inside
 * `runBuild` that no `finally` sees, from an `exit` listener. A process killed
 * by a signal runs neither and leaves its one directory.
 *
 * `--keep-pages` (issue #1339) is the same read, refusals-first and stage
 * rules included, ending in a different build: `build --atlas-in` over the
 * input atlas, which resolves every part to a region of the pack already on
 * disk and writes no page, and then the document alone (`keptPagesDocument`).
 * A flag rather than a verb, because its flow is this one minus the lift and
 * the pages — a second verb would be a second copy of every refusal above
 * the build, free to drift from this one.
 *
 * ⚠️ The lifted parts are not kept: the output is the input's shape, and the
 * parts are recoverable from it at any time by the same lift — keeping a
 * second copy of every texel beside the pages would be two records of one
 * thing that can disagree.

/**
 * `--keep-pages`' tail (issue #1339): `build --atlas-in` over the input atlas
 * — the build that resolves every part against a pack somebody already made
 * and writes no page — then the two checks that say the document it spelled
 * describes the files on disk, then the one write.
 *
 * The input atlas and its pages are staged as copies in the build's own
 * directory, so `--atlas-in`'s re-anchored page names (`relative(outDir, …)`)
 * are the atlas's own spellings and the document's `pages` names what sits
 * beside the input skeleton. Nothing under the input is opened for writing.
 *
 *   (a) the document's `pages` are `pagesOfAtlas` of the input atlas text,
 *       field for field — what `build` would have stated had it written this
 *       atlas itself;
 *   (b) the rebuilt `skeleton.json` is byte-identical to the input's, so the
 *       document's `spine.sha256` names the file it will sit beside. There is
 *       no acceptance here: a digest of a skeleton that is not on disk is the
 *       document the command exists not to write;
 *   (c) the gate is green — `runBuild` returns only then.
