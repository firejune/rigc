/**

 * `cli_core.ts` runs as `build` (`CORE_ENTRY_RUNS`, issue #1060): `runBuild`
 * with a gate that links none of the runtime.
 *
 * Which commands these are is not a list kept here: it is `COMMANDS`'s
 * `runtime` field (`./shared.ts`), which `RC26` in `selftest.ts` holds to the
 * import graph of this module. A body here that reaches the runtime turns it

/**
 * The `MEMBER` report block — a group track's per-member values, side by side
 * (issue #295).
 *
 * ## Why side by side is the whole point
 *
 * The complaint that filed #295 was not the line count. `gallery/portrait`'s
 * held yaw put six sibling bones' `translatex` in six separate tracks, and the
 * reason that is bad is that **nobody can see a wrong sign in a column that is
 * eighty lines from its neighbours.** FACE §3 makes the same argument from the
 * other side: a residual is 1–6 units where a total is 30–40, and the split is
 * *an auditing decision before it is a rigging one*. So the report's job is to
 * put the numbers in the arrangement the audit needs — one row per member, one
 * block per key — which is exactly the arrangement the emitted format cannot
 * have, because Spine keys one bone per timeline.
 *
 * ## It quotes; it does not re-derive
 *
 * The same rule as the `DEFORM` block. Every value here is the one the compiler
 * **emitted**, carried on `result.trackDerivations`, so the block and the
 * artifact cannot disagree. `derived` and `formula` are the model's own strings
 * from `src/trackgen.ts`, so the block names the closed form the spec stated
 * rather than a second reading of it.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not print
 *
 * **Tracks whose members all share one value** — the ordinary `groups` entry.
 * There is one number there and the timelines above already show it on every
 * member; a table of six identical rows would be a tautology, and the block
 * exists to make a *difference* visible. `look_l`/`look_r` in the worked example
 * are exactly that case and they are right to be absent from here.
 *
 * **`stagger`.** A per-member time offset is printed as it always was — on each
 * member's own timeline, where the shifted key times are. Repeating it here
 * would put one lag in two places.

/**
 * The `DEFORM` report block — what each deform key does to the geometry, per key
 * and then per animation (issue #316).
 *
 * ## Why this is a report and not an assertion
 *
 * Because a 3× stretch is a real thing to author, for the same reason issue #277
 * settled mesh coverage as a printed figure on authored geometry rather than a
 * bar. The one deformed-geometry fault that has no legitimate counter-example is
 * the fold, and that one already IS an assertion —
 * `A39_DEFORM_KEEPS_TRIANGLE_WINDING`. What this block adds is **the approach to
 * that wall**: FACE §4.2's table of ratios down to the fold at 31.37° was
 * measured by rendering seven variants of `gallery/portrait` and looking at them,
 * and `0.637` was a number an author derived from the closed form rather than one
 * the tool printed.
 *
 * ## It quotes; it does not re-derive
 *
 * - the reversal and collapse counts are the **survey's**, which is A39's own
 *   survey ([`src/deformmeasure.ts`](src/deformmeasure.ts)) — one measurement,
 *   two readers, so the block and the gate cannot disagree about a fold;
 * - 🔒 and so is **the frame each key was posed in** (issue #407), which every
 *   `DEFORM` line now names: `on a track`, or the slider that applies the
 *   animation and the dial value its own mapping had to be inverted to. The
 *   derivation moved and the report had to move with it — a block that went on
 *   printing the same figures under a changed meaning would be worse than the
 *   red it replaced;
 * - a key's model is the **compiler's** `transform` report (§4.11.1), so the
 *   block names the same `kind` and parameters the spec stated;
 * - the fold ANGLE is nowhere here. It is A39's, derived at run time from the
 *   grid, and a second copy of it printed beside a ratio would be a number that
 *   goes stale when somebody moves a column;
 * - and a key the gate read **no winding** off — because the slot draws no pixels
 *   of the mesh at that key's own time (issue #401) — says so on a `skipped` line
 *   with the survey's own sentence, and is kept out of the rollup's counts,
 *   because that line ends by claiming A39 reads the same two;
 * - the **spans** between the keys are the survey's too (issue #403). A `BETWEEN`
 *   line appears wherever the closed form found a fold at a time no key lands
 *   on, whether the gate refuses it or passes it over because nothing is drawn
 *   there — and a `spans` line says how many were scanned even when nothing was
 *   found, because a scan that ran and found nothing has to be distinguishable
 *   from a scan that never ran.
 *
 * ## And what it deliberately does not print
 *
 * **Deformed coverage**, which #296 asked for. The coverage figure is rasterised
 * from the attachment's **uvs** against the part's alpha, and a deform moves
 * positions and never uvs — so it is identical at every key by construction, and
 * a `coverage 100.00% (setup 100.00%)` line would be a tautology wearing a
 * measurement's clothes. The header line says so and points at `meshes`, because
 * an author who came here asking whether their deform broke the coverage
 * deserves the answer rather than a silence. What does move is the stretch.

/**
 * Refuse a compiled pair whose art `explain` cannot pose through, by name.
 *
 * 🚨 `explain` poses the rig — `deformReportLines` measures what each deform key
 * did — and spine-core's reading of the pair resolves EVERY attachment against
 * the atlas, whether or not anything deforms it. (Since issue #1019 a build's
 * survey is read off its model document and posed by the core, which resolves
 * nothing against the atlas; spine-core reads it under `--poser spine` and on a
 * fallback, and this refusal is unchanged and comes before either.) On the specs
 * `ingest --art none` writes there is nothing to resolve against: the entries
 * state a size and name no `image`, so the compile atlases nothing, and the load
 * threw the runtime's own `Region not found in atlas: rear-upper-arm (attachment:
 * rear-upper-arm)` with a spine-core stack trace under it and exit 1 (measured on
 * `examples/spineboy/export/spineboy-ess.json`, issue #697). That is the tool
 * telling an agent about its own internals instead of about the rig, on the one
 * input `docs/INGEST.md` §2.0 documents as the route through a foreign skeleton.
 *
 * ⭐ Both halves of the join are rigc's own readers rather than a second opinion
 * on somebody else's format: the walk is `attachmentRegionJoins`, which `PS127`
 * measures against the loader's own `findRegion` calls, and the region names come
 * from `parseAtlasText`, which is what `--atlas-in` already resolves against.
 * Names are compared EXACTLY — as `A08` compares them and as `findRegion`
 * matches them — so a padded region name is a miss on both sides.
 *
 * ⚠️ What it deliberately does not do is catch the pose. A blanket `try` around
 * `skeletonDataFromText` would convert any exception the runtime raises into a
 * sentence claiming the cause is missing art, and a rigc defect reported under
 * somebody else's name is the doctrine's second bullet inverted. This refuses
 * the case it can NAME, before a line of the report is printed, and leaves
 * anything else to arrive as itself.
