 * What a path names as a build — the one statement of it every command that

 * ⭐ A build is a directory holding `skeleton.json` and `skeleton.atlas`, and
 * `skeleton.model.json` beside them when rigc wrote it — or a `.json`
 * skeleton named directly, a foreign export's. A directory holding no
 * `skeleton.json`, or a path with nothing at it, is refused here, `nothing at
 * <path>`, for every command alike: before this, `validate` read the missing
 * file unguarded and died on an ENOENT and a stack (#1046), and `diff` on a
 * directory on an EISDIR. What a command then needs beyond the skeleton is the
 * command's to say — `spinePairOf` for the atlas, `resolveDrawable` for a
 * rigc build drawn without one.
 *
 * Two shapes of target, because rigc's own output and a foreign export are
 * named differently and both have to be gateable. rigc writes
 * `skeleton.json` + `skeleton.atlas` into a directory. Everybody else writes
 * whatever the editor called the project, and the official examples are not
 * even consistent with themselves — `7-anticipation/export/` holds
 * `sack-pro.json`, `spineboy/export/` holds two skeletons and two atlases.
 *
 * ⚠️ When more than one atlas sits beside a named skeleton, the atlas is not
 * chosen: guessing by name would be wrong on the corpus that motivated it —
 * `spineboy-ess` shares a longer prefix with `spineboy-run.atlas` than with
 * the `spineboy.atlas` it actually uses, so the plausible heuristic picks the
 * wrong file and every attachment then resolves against the wrong pixels —
 * silently, which is the exact failure mode this tool exists to remove. The
 * refusal is the atlas's (`atlasRefusal`), said by a command that reads one;
 * `diff`, which reads the skeleton alone, is not refused for it.

 *
 * The atlas line beside this clause prints the DRAWING's size, because that is
 * what an attachment's width and height mean. A packer that turned the drawing a
 * quarter to fit it wrote `bounds:` in the drawing's orientation too. So an
 * author holding the pack and the build report had neither end of the rectangle
 * they have to cut out of the page to measure a part against a rendered frame —
 * and the one place rigc printed it was `A06`'s overlap text, reachable only
 * under `--profile spine-html`. The knowledge was in the tree the whole time:
 * `pageFootprint` has derived this rectangle for every reader of it since issue
 * #579, and nothing an author reads said it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The condition is `pageFootprint`'s own answer, not a second reading of
 * `degrees`.** Re-spelling that predicate here is the exact duplication #579 was
 * filed on — four readers derived this rectangle and two derived it wrongly — so
 * the clause asks the function whether its answer differs from the `bounds:`
 * line, and prints only then.
 *
 * 🔸 A consequence worth stating rather than leaving to be discovered: a region
 * whose KEPT rectangle is square is silent here, because a quarter turn leaves
 * its footprint the same two numbers and there is nothing the pack does not
 * already say. The general rule — `bounds` is the unturned size, the footprint
 * is its transpose at `rotate: 90` and `rotate: 270`, and which way to turn the
 * rectangle to recover the drawing — belongs to an author's own reading and is
 * stated in `docs/AUTHORING.md` §0.2, which holds for every region including
