 * outright, naming the section, the attachment and the rule.
 *
 * 🚨 Writing it moves a second field with it. For the two types that carry
 * texture art, `path` defaults to **`name`**, not to the placeholder
 * (`:529`, `:559`), so an attachment given a name and no path resolves its region

 * dereferences `map.lengths.length` unconditionally, so an absent array is one of
 * the format's few loud failures; rigc measures the numbers off the geometry
 * rather than letting a spec restate them.
 *
 * ⚠️ That sentence read *"the cumulative **arc** length"* until issue #560, and
 * the word was load-bearing in the wrong direction: this is not an arc length,
 * and no refinement of the integral converges on it. It is the number the
 * field's own consumer computes when it is not given one. ⇒ Do not derive a
 * physical quantity from it — how far a wheel rolls, how long a ribbon is.
 * `position` is stated against it; arc length is not it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The EDITOR writes `vertexCount / 3` entries on BOTH — measured**
 * (round trip 6, 2026-09-16, Spine 4.3.26). It computes the wrap-around curve
 * even for an open path: `gallery/ride`'s 12-vertex open path came back with
 * **four** entries on 2026-09-04 (4.3.23) and the fourth, `2136.228`, is the
 * *closed*-chain cumulative. ⚠️ Neither array is wrong, and this is not a case
 * of the editor knowing something rigc does not. `SkeletonJson.js:601` allocates
 * `Utils.newArray(vertexCount / 3, 0)` and copies whatever is there, while
 * `PathConstraint` reads at most `lengths[curveCount]` with
 * `curveCount = verticesLength / 6 − (closed ? 1 : 2)` — index 2 on that path.
 * The trailing entry the editor adds to an open path is never read by anything.
 *
 * 🚨 **What the editor writes INTO those entries is its own measurement, and it
 * is the runtime's, not calculus'** (issue #560, measured on the same trip).
 * `PathConstraint`'s `constantSpeed` re-measure is a four-sample forward
 * difference per curve — its constants are `0.1875 = 3t²`, `0.09375 = 6t³` and
 * `(cx1 − x1) · 0.75 = 3t` at **t = 1/4**, accumulating four `Math.sqrt` terms —
 * and the editor's stored `lengths` are that same computation. A 4-sample chord
 * sum over the same control points reproduces the editor to every digit it
 * prints, on two rigs and two editor builds: `pathmodes` (closed, 4.3.26) came
 * back `[152.7006, 305.4012, 458.1019, 610.8025]` and `ride` (open, 4.3.23)
 * `[430.8389, 838.0142, 1127.736, …]`. It is a recomputation at **export** — the
 * inflated `.spine` project holds the imported numbers verbatim — so a path rig
 * is re-parameterised by the trip rather than corrupted by it.
 *
 * ⇒ **rigc emits that computation, not a sampler aimed at it** (issue #560).
 * `pathCurveLengths` in [`compile.ts`](compile.ts) is `PathConstraint.js:301-320`
 * transcribed, down to `Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)` rather than `Math.hypot`
 * and `0.16666667` rather than `1 / 6`; `PS67`–`PS69` in `selftest.ts` hold it
 * there by requiring it to reproduce a real `PathConstraint.curves` array **bit
 * for bit** on the runtime's own posed chain. Measured after the change, all
 * seven entries of both editor exports above come back at the precision the
 * editor prints them.
 *
 * ⚠️ This paragraph used to point at a constant — `PATH_LENGTH_SAMPLES` — and ask
 * *how finely rigc should sample*. There is no such constant now, and the
 * question was the wrong one. The chord-sum reading above is true and it is not
 * sufficient: a 4-sample chord sum agrees with the forward difference to about
 * **nine significant digits**, which is *below* what float32 can hold — so no
 * editor export can tell the two apart, and that reading can only settle the
 * MODEL — and *above* rigc's six-decimal rounding, so the emitted file can. On
 * both rigs above the two spellings round apart on the **last** curve, where the
 * running total has accumulated most: `610.802519` against `610.802520`, and
 * `1127.735817` against `1127.735818`. So the editor is the evidence for what is
 * being computed and only the runtime is evidence for how.
 *
 * 📌 For the record of what the disagreement cost when it was found: the build
 * rigc **0.21.0** emitted for `pathmodes` sat a uniform **0.70 %** above the
 * editor's four numbers, and `check` read **4.9612 mean MAE** against 0.0000 on
 * the seven rigs of that run without a path. ⚠️ What decides whether that moves a
 * pixel is the POSITION mode, not the spacing mode: `pathmodes` is
 * `positionMode: fixed`, where an absolute `position` is compared against a total
 * that scaled, so the bone slides. Under `positionMode: percent` a uniform scale
 * cancels out of both the position and the spacing — `gallery/ride` is
 * percent/percent and every one of its 74 rendered frames came back **byte
 * identical** across this change, on an emitted array all three of whose numbers
 * moved. `A33_VERTEX_ATTACHMENT_GEOMETRY` asks only that the array strictly
 * increase, which both arrays do, and `diff` does not compare it at all.

   * `events` is emitted in the order the rig spec declares them.

   *
   * - **The re-key is not in codepoint order.** It is natural and
   *   case-insensitive: `Turn, sweep, wave` came back `sweep, Turn, wave` and
   *   `turn10, turn2, zoom` came back `turn2, turn10, zoom` (#539). rigc emits
   *   `animations` in **that** comparator's order since issue #543, and since
   *   #728 the comparator itself is measured rather than quantified over —
   *   five stored round trips, folders and all — so only what those files leave
   *   open is refused by name. See `compile.ts`'s `editorNameOrder` and
   *   `refuseNamesTheEditorCouldKeyDifferently`. It emitted codepoint until
   *   #543, with the refusal widened to cover every pair codepoint could order
   *   differently; that refused both rigs above, which are the only two anybody
   *   had measured then, and it moved no byte to stop doing so.
   * - 🚨 **`skins` is NOT an array the editor leaves alone. It is the first one
   *   measured moved** (#541). A four-skin rig built `default, zulu, mike,
   *   alpha` came back `default, alpha, mike, zulu`: `default` is pinned first
   *   and the rest are re-sorted, and the deform timelines came back keyed
   *   `mike, zulu` rather than `zulu, mike` with it. `SkeletonBinary` addresses

   *   `skins[skinIndex]` for a linked mesh — so this is #535 in the collection
   *   nobody had checked. rigc emits `default` first and the rest in that
   *   order since #541; see `compile.ts`'s `editorSkinOrder`.
   *
   *   ⚠️ **The two readings this replaces, kept because the second is the one
   *   that cost something.** #537's pull request called `skins` "measured
   *   preserved"; #544 corrected that to *unmeasured*, on the grounds that the
   *   arrays the round trip actually returned element for element were `bones`
   *   (30), `slots` (24) and `constraints` (3), that every rig in this tree
   *   declares exactly ONE skin, and that a one-element array comes back in
   *   order whatever the editor does with it. Both readings were reached by
   *   generalising from the three arrays that *were* measured — "an editor does
   *   not move arrays" — and the generalisation is what was false. #544 also
   *   said the measurement could not be taken, because the editor refused a
   *   four-skin rig on import without a word: that refusal was rigc's own
   *   harness discarding the editor's stderr, and the editor had named the
   *   cause all along.
   *
   * - ✅ **What round trip 6 added to the `constraints` line is TYPES, not
   *   order** (2026-09-16, Spine 4.3.26, eight rigs). The three that stood here
   *   were `gallery/look`'s, and they are two types: `yaw` and `tilt`
   *   (**slider**) and `whip` (**physics**). The trip carried a `transform`
   *   with its whole 4.3 `source` + `properties` map, a `path` with three
   *   non-default modes, another `physics` and another `slider`, and every one
   *   came back field for field — so the array is now measured over **four**
   *   of the format's types. `ik` is in none of the rigs anybody has
   *   round-tripped, which is why the count is four and not five.
   *
   *   ⚠️ **None of round 6's own constraint arrays can tell order preserved
   *   from a name sort, and reading them as if they could would be #537's
   *   mistake in a second collection.** The three rigs that carry constraints
   *   hold `aim, hold` (xform), `hold, knob` (physlider) and `ride` alone
   *   (pathmodes). All three came back in the order they were given — and all
   *   three were *already* in name order, so a re-sort and a preservation are
   *   the same picture there, exactly as a one-element array is for `skins`
   *   above. ⇒ The order claim still rests entirely on `gallery/look`, whose
   *   build order `yaw, tilt, whip` is **not** name order (`tilt < whip < yaw`)
   *   and which #539 read back unchanged. That one rig is load-bearing and
   *   nothing in this tree re-takes it.
