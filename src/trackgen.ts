/**
 * A group track's **per-member** values, evaluated from a model the spec states.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * `groups` keys several bones **identically**, which is the right tool for a
 * wheel pair and the wrong one for a face: on a face the whole content of the
 * motion is that each part gets a *different* number. `gallery/portrait`'s held
 * 12° yaw was **20 tracks**, sixteen of them the same two properties on six
 * sibling bones with identical times, identical easings and six different
 * values — so `groups` bought exactly one of the sixteen, the pair that happened
 * to share `cos t` (issue #295).
 *
 * And not one of those numbers was a judgement either. Each feature's own
 * `translatex` is `x·(cos t − 1) − (z − R)·sin t` and its `scalex` is
 * `cos(α − t)/cos α` — docs/FACE.md §3 and §5 derive both, and the *only* free
 * parameter per member is its **depth**. So this is `src/deformgen.ts`'s move on
 * the bone half of the same turn: **the spec states the model and the compiler
 * states the numbers.**
 *
 * ⭐ **The depth table is the point, not the line count.** FACE §2's sharp edge
 * is that `x` is in the file and `z` is not — `grep -c '"z"'` over the worked
 * example's two specs returned `0` and `0`, and every depth that produced every
 * number lived only in a README beside them. A `derive` key states each
 * member's depth, so the table a reader needs in order to check a sign is in the
 * file that uses it.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT, and the rules that keep it that way
 *
 * 1. **It never authors.** Every parameter arrives from the spec — the angle,
 *    each member's depth, what the parent already carries. The one number read
 *    off the rig is the member bone's own **setup position**, which is the same
 *    licence `evaluateDeformTransform` has to read an attachment's setup
 *    vertices: it is a coordinate the spec already states, resolved by name.
 * 2. **It generates no in-betweens.** MOTION §7 refuses a `rigc tween`. A model
 *    is evaluated **at one key**, from parameters that key states, and what
 *    happens between two keys is still the timeline's own curve. Sweeping an
 *    angle is editing one number per key.
 * 3. **It does not do timing.** `stagger` already shifts a member's keys in
 *    member order (AUTHORING §4.3), so nothing here takes a phase, an index or
 *    a delay. Two mechanisms for one lag would mean two places to look for it.
 * 4. **It is one closed form per kind, named and refusable.** There is no
 *    expression language here and no `v` that is a formula string: a kind the
 *    compiler does not know is refused *by name*, which is the whole reason a
 *    reviewer can check a claim.
 *
 * ## Determinism
 *
 * Each closed form is a fixed sequence of float64 operations over numbers read
 * from the spec, evaluated in **member order** — the group's own array order,
 * never an iteration over an unordered set. The caller quantises with the
 * compiler's `r6`, so the same spec emits the same bytes and
 * `A18_DETERMINISTIC_EMIT` proves it on a second independent compile.
