/**
 * The atlas as a data structure: read one, pack one, write one.
 *
 * Until issue #4 rigc had exactly one atlas shape — one part, one page, region
 * covers the page — and one function that wrote it (`buildAtlasText` in
 * [`src/compile.ts`](compile.ts)). That is why the npm keyword `atlas` set an
 * expectation the tool did not meet: nine loose PNGs compiled to `pages=9
 * regions=9`, which is correct, valid, and not what anybody means by an atlas.
 *
 * This module holds the three pieces that were missing, and nothing else:
 *
 *   * `parseAtlasText` — the format read back in, so an atlas somebody else
 *     packed can be an INPUT (`build --atlas-in`);
 *   * `packAtlas` — loose part PNGs arranged onto shared pages (`build --pack`);
 *   * `writeAtlasText` — the one emitter for both shapes, so the unpacked
 *     default and a packed page are written by the same code.
 *
 * ## 🚨 Two invariants this file exists to keep
 *
 * **Packing is an OUTPUT arrangement, never an input contract.** Sizes are still
 * measured from the loose PNGs by `readPngInfo` before anything here runs, the
 * skeleton is compiled from those measurements, and `--pack` changes only where
 * the bytes sit on a page. A packed build's `skeleton.json` is byte-identical to
 * the unpacked one's — that is a property of this split, and the selftest
 * asserts it rather than trusting it.
 *
 * **A packed region is a lossless copy.** Nothing here resamples, scales, trims
 * or rotates: a region's pixels are written to the page unchanged, and the
 * selftest lifts every region back off its page and compares it byte for byte
 * against the loose PNG (`PK02`). See `extrudeCell` for the one thing that has to
 * be ADDED to the page for the render to agree as well, and `PACK_NO_ROTATE` for
 * the field this deliberately does not use.
 *
 * Under `shape: 'polygon'` (issue #1099) the copy is lossless where a region
 * can be SAMPLED: two rectangles may overlap where neither region draws, so a
 * mesh region's rectangle outside its hull may carry a neighbour's texels, and
 * the claim the selftest holds there is that every texel within a tap of what
 * a region draws is its own (`PK79`). See `packAtlas`, *`shape: 'polygon'`*.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The rendered pictures are equal to within one least significant bit, not
 * bit-for-bit, and the difference is arithmetic rather than texels.** Measured: 0
 * to 480 channel samples of 7 to 21 million on the three public fixtures, worst
 * difference **1**, against 22,000 to 60,000 samples and a worst difference of
 * **77** when the gutter is removed — and byte-identical on eleven of the
 * repository's thirteen rigs across 1,101 frames. The two that are not are the
 * two with meshes.
 *
 * 🔬 **Where that last bit is lost, measured (issue #266, follow-up 1).** This
 * paragraph used to say the cause was rigc's own sampling coordinate — `fl(regionX
 * + fl(s · width))` failing to be exact once `regionX > 0` — and that the repair
 * was to sample in region-local coordinates and add the integer page origin to the
 * tap indices. **Both halves are wrong, and the second is unreachable.** Poses of
 * the loose and the packed build of one skeleton, compared coordinate by
 * coordinate as `u · pageWidth − regionX` against the loose `u · pageWidth`:
 *
 *   * on every **region** attachment the difference is **exactly 0**. `regionX`,
 *     `regionWidth` and `pageWidth` are integers and the page is a power of two,
 *     so `u · pageWidth` recovers `regionX + localTexel` with nothing lost —
 *     which is why the eleven region-only rigs are already byte-identical, and
 *     why `PK18` can assert exactness rather than a bound. That holds for the
 *     default power-of-two page only: `pageEdges: 'free'` gives it up, and the
 *     region attachments of a free page sit at the mesh's bound of 1 (`PK72`,
 *     and `packAtlas`, *free*);
 *   * on a **mesh** it is **not** 0 — 88 of 88 coordinates on `gallery/squash`'s
 *     ball, worst 3.15e-5 texels — because `spine-core` stores mesh page UVs in a
 *     **`Float32Array`**. `MeshAttachment.updateRegion` computes `u +
 *     regionUVs[i] · width` and rounds the whole thing to float32, so the low bits
 *     of the scaled coordinate are gone **before rigc reads the array**. The
 *     counterfactual settles which term does it: the same region at page origin
 *     `x = 0` still lands 9.5e-7 texels off the loose value, so it is the `f32(u ·
 *     regionWidth / pageWidth)` scaling and not the origin addition.
 *
 * ⇒ **No change to [`src/render.ts`](render.ts) can recover it**, because it reads
 * `piece.uvs` and the information is not in there. The only routes are for rigc to
 * re-derive mesh page UVs from `MeshAttachment.regionUVs` in double precision —
 * a second opinion about the runtime's own trim and rotation mapping, which
 * `src/render.ts` refuses by name (see `artUvsOf`) — or one part per page, which
 * is the unpacked convention. And the first would be worse than the residual: the
 * renderer is the yardstick `check` measures a candidate against *because* it
 * draws what a runtime draws, and a runtime playing this atlas gets the float32
 * numbers. Making two rigc renders agree by disagreeing with the runtime is the
 * wrong trade. So the bound stays a bound, `PK18` attributes it, and the follow-up
 * is closed as measured rather than done.
 *
 * ## Why a second parser for a format `spine-core` already parses
 *
 * `src/compile.ts` must stay independent of the runtime — that is what keeps the
 * compiler and the gate from checking each other's assumptions — so the importer
 * cannot reach for `TextureAtlas`. The reader below therefore states, for every
 * field the format has, what the runtime reads it as — the page and region
 * fields of `dist/TextureAtlas.js` — including the readings that look like
 * mistakes and are not: the page name is trimmed and a region name is the RAW
 * line, a blank line closes a page block, an entry holds at most four values,
 * and `originalWidth/Height` fall back to `width/height` only when BOTH are
 * zero.
 *
 * A second opinion about a format is a liability, so it is measured rather than
 * asserted: `PKR01` parses every `.atlas` in the example corpus with both this
 * reader and `spine-core`'s `TextureAtlas` and compares every page's name, size
 * and `pma` and every region's eleven fields — 10 atlas files, 132 regions, 3
 * of them rotated, 0 fields apart when this was written (issue #1015). If they
 * ever disagree, that control goes red and this file is wrong.

/**
 * The rectangle a region occupies **on its page** — which is not the rectangle

 * region that covers `height x width` of the page. 180 turns nothing: the
 * footprint is the drawing's own way round at 0 and at 180, and transposed at 90
 * and at 270.
 *
 * ## Why this is one function and was four (issue #579)
 *
 * Four readers in this tree want exactly this rectangle — `windowOf` in
 * [`src/render.ts`](render.ts) fences a substituted piece with it,
 * `resolveFromAtlas` in [`src/compile.ts`](compile.ts) refuses a region that
 * runs off its page by it, and `A06` and `A19` in [`src/validate.ts`](validate.ts)
 * measure a shared page's tiling and open one region's own texels with it — and
 * two of the four transposed at 90 **only**, under a comment that read *"spine-core
 * transposes a region's extent at 90 and not at 270 when it derives the UVs, so
 * the rectangle ON THE PAGE follows the same rule"*.
 *
 * The premise is true and the conclusion does not follow, because the two are
 * different quantities:
 *
 *   * what `TextureAtlas` transposes at 90 and not at 270 is `u2`/`v2`
 *     (spine-core 4.3.13, `dist/TextureAtlas.js:162-171`) — so at 270 those two
 *     numbers do describe a rectangle the page does not have;
 *   * but `MeshAttachment.computeUVs` (`dist/attachments/MeshAttachment.js:118-162`)
 *     never reads `u2`/`v2` for an atlas region. It branches on `degrees` and
 *     derives the span from `originalWidth`/`originalHeight`, transposed at 90
 *     **and** at 270 alike. That is the routine that says where a region's texels
 *     are, and `extractRegion` below is its inverse.
 *
 * ⚠️ The consequence was not confined to a printed number, which is what the
 * card assumed. A19 opens a shared page and scans one region's own rectangle for
 * a transparent texel: at 270 it scanned `width x height` where the drawing
 * occupies `height x width`, ran off the part into the transparent gutter, found
 * its texel there and **named nothing**. Two fully opaque parts on one turned
 * page — the exact defect A19 exists for — were measured green at `rotate: 270`
 * and red at 0, 90 and 180.
 *
 * Structurally typed rather than taking `AtlasRegion`, because two of the four
 * callers hold spine-core's `TextureAtlasRegion` instead and this file
 * deliberately does not link the runtime.

/**
 * ⛔ The packer never rotates, so `rotate: 0` is a fact rather than a field.
 *
 * The format supports `rotate: 90` and the Spine packer uses it — every official
 * example that has a tall thin part ships one. rigc's does not, for reasons that
 * are about honesty rather than difficulty:
 *
 *   * `artUvsOf` ([`src/render.ts`](render.ts)) already refuses a rotated region,
 *     because `RegionAttachment.computeUVs` assigns a different corner order at
 *     90° and `TextureAtlas` transposes `u2/v2` at 90 and not at 270. A packer
 *     that emitted rotation would be writing atlases its own `--atlas`
 *     substitution cannot read;
 *   * the whole feature is gated on how closely the packed render matches the
 *     unpacked one, and a transposed region is sampled through a different
 *     mapping — the gate would then be measuring the mapping rather than the pack.
 *
 * Rotation buys page area on a set of parts whose aspect ratios differ a lot. It
 * is not free and it is not implemented; a page that runs out of room spills to a
 * second page instead.
 *
 * 🔬 **Measured for issue #860, and held back on the measurement.** A pack that
 * turned regions `rotate: 90` lifted every one of them back byte for byte through
 * `extractRegion` (22 of 22 and 20 of 20 on two painting rigs, 12 turned on each),
 * and rigc's renderer drew the turned region attachments with 0 differing pixels
 * against the unturned pack. But on neither rig did a turn shrink the page: both
 * were already on the smallest power-of-two page their area allows, and a turn
 * that buys no area only moves bytes. Shipping it would also need two clauses
 * changed that say rigc never turns a region — `A06`'s under `spine-html`
 * ([`src/validate.ts`](validate.ts)) and `artUvsOf`
 * ([`src/render.ts`](render.ts)), which returns no art UVs for a turned region
 * attachment, so `check`'s texture substitution would report it unmatched.
 *
 * 📏 **Measured again for issue #866, on twelve region sets, and held back again.**
 * The sets are the two painting rigs above and ten production rigs of 20 to 22
 * parts. Each was packed by this file's own search at padding 2 twice: as
 * shipped, and with every cell also tried turned under the same BSSF score
 * (ties go to the unturned cell). The shipped search reproduced the page every
 * one of the twelve atlases was written at. Area change from turning:
 *
 *   | set | `pot` | `pot` + turn | `free` | `free` + turn |
 *   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 *   | 22-part painting | 1024x2048 | 0.00 % | 1888x697 | −1.14 % |
 *   | 20-part painting | 512x2048 | 0.00 % | 480x1166 | +2.31 % |
 *   | P1 | 512x2048 | 0.00 % | 416x1633 | +1.43 % |
 *   | P2 | 1024x1024 | 0.00 % | 1184x810 | +0.70 % |
 *   | P3 | 512x1024 | 0.00 % | 480x1000 | +2.96 % |
 *   | P4 | 1024x2048 | 0.00 % | 864x1346 | −6.16 % |
 *   | P5 | 2048x2048 | 0.00 % | 1344x1768 | −13.37 % |
 *   | P6 | 1024x2048 | 0.00 % | 800x1934 | −1.62 % |
 *   | P7 | 512x2048 | 0.00 % | 1024x928 | −0.05 % |
 *   | P8 | 512x2048 | 0.00 % | 608x1250 | −4.96 % |
 *   | P9 | 1024x2048 | +100.00 % | 1024x2037 | +6.51 % |
 *   | P10 | 512x2048 | 0.00 % | 352x1433 | +0.70 % |
 *
 * Under `pot` a turn shrank no page on any set, and on P9 an ungated one doubled
 * it. Under `free` the largest gain, P5's 13.37 %, is inside the search's own
 * noise: the nearest other width on the 32-px grid the search then used moves
 * P5's unturned page by 18.13 %, and searching every width instead of every
 * 32nd finds an unturned P5 page 10.22 % smaller with nothing turned. With every
 * width searched, the largest turn gain on any set is 5.05 % (P5), then 4.96 %
 * (P8) and 4.22 % (P4). That is not a page worth two readers changing, so the
 * packer still never turns a region.
 *
 * ⚠️ The `free` column and the 18.13 % are measurements of the search as it was
 * on that day, a 32-px width grid. Issue #872 replaced it with every width (see
 * `FREE_EDGE_STEP`), so today's `free` pages for these sets are the every-width
 * ones the paragraph above compares against, and the 5.05 % is the turn gain
 * measured on the search that ships.

 * The atlas text for these pages — the ONE emitter, for both atlas shapes.
 *
 * Two text-shape traps are load-bearing (A07 checks both): a region name is the
 * RAW line, so it carries no indentation, and a blank line closes a page block,
 * so there is none between a page header and its regions. Exactly one blank line
 * sits BETWEEN pages and none trails the last.
 *
 * The unpacked default goes through here too (`buildAtlasText` builds one page
 * per image and calls this), which is what makes "the defaults change nothing" a
 * property of one function instead of a promise made by two.
 *
 * ⭐ **No pages is the empty FILE, not a blank line** (issue #608). A compile that
 * measured no art — a rig whose skins fill no slot with anything that needs a
 * page — used to come out of here as `"\n"`, because `[].join('\n')` is `''` and
 * the trailing newline was appended unconditionally. That one byte contradicts
 * the paragraph above it: a blank line is the separator that sits BETWEEN page
 * blocks, so a file consisting of one is a separator with nothing on either side.
 * `A07_ATLAS_TEXT_SHAPE` reads a file with no non-blank line as having no page
 * block and reports SKIP, and refuses a blank line that trails a page block as
 * `the file ends with a blank line`.
 *
 * The runtime cannot tell the two apart — `new TextureAtlas('')`,
 * `new TextureAtlas('\n')` and `new TextureAtlas('\n\n')` all come back with
 * `pages.length === 0` and `regions.length === 0`, and the constructor
 * (`TextureAtlas.js:97-174`) has no `throw` in it at all — so the runtime is no
 * help in choosing, and the choice is made on what the text SAYS. Zero bytes has
 * exactly one reading; a blank line has two, and the wrong one is the one A07 was
 * built to catch.

 * The smallest `free` page that holds these cells, and where they land on it —

 *
 * The rule, which `docs/AUTHORING.md` §0.1 states in the same words:
 *
 *   * the candidate WIDTHS are every whole width from the widest cell up to
 *     `maxEdge` (`FREE_EDGE_STEP` is 1);
 *   * at each width the cells are placed by the same MaxRects pass as a `pot`
 *     page, on a page `maxEdge` tall, and the HEIGHT is the bottom edge of the
 *     lowest cell — what that placement needs, not rounded;
 *   * the page with the least area wins, then the squarer (smaller |width −
 *     height|), then the narrower. Every candidate has a distinct width, so that
 *     last key makes the order total and the answer a function of the cells.
 *
 * ⚠️ The height is read off one placement rather than searched for, and that is
 * a definition, not an approximation of one: MaxRects' success is not monotonic
 * in the page height (a shorter page changes which free rectangle scores best),
 * so "the least height that fits" is not a quantity a bisection could find, and a
 * definition that could not be computed exactly would not be deterministic.
 *
 * ⭐ **Two bounds make every width cheap, and neither can change the answer**
 * (issue #872). Both compare against the best page found so far, and both are
 * strict, so a width that could still TIE the best — and win on the squarer or
 * narrower key — is always placed to the end:
 *
 *   * a width is not placed at all when the cells' own area exceeds
 *     `width x maxEdge` (it cannot fit), or when `width x` the tallest cell
 *     already exceeds the best area (no page at that width is shorter than its
 *     tallest cell);
 *   * a placement is abandoned the moment its lowest cell's bottom edge makes
 *     `width x bottom` exceed the best area. The bottom edge only grows as cells
 *     are added, so the page that placement would have finished is larger still.
 *
 * Neither changes a placement that runs to the end — the pass is the `pot` pass,
 * on the same page, and abandoning it only stops it early — so the winner is the
 * every-width winner, and `PK75` compares the two on every set it builds. What
 * they save, measured on the twelve sets: 391,854 cell placements for an
 * unbounded every-width search, 47,978 bounded, against 12,361 for the retired

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * A cell as `shape: 'polygon'` places it: the region plus `padding` on every
 * side, and the cell texels the region OWNS — its protected set.
 *
 * ## The protected set, and why it is the footprint test
 *
 * A region attachment owns its whole cell, exactly the cell `shape: 'rect'`
 * keeps apart from every other: it draws its whole quad, and its gutter is what
 * makes its edge sample as the loose page's does (`extrudeCell`).
 *
 * A mesh region owns every cell texel `t` whose unit square, grown by `reach =
 * max(padding, 1)` texels on every side (a Chebyshev dilation), meets one of
 * the region's footprint polygons, closed — boundary contact counts. Then:
 *
 *   * it holds every texel the mesh can sample. A bilinear tap at a point `q`
 *     inside a triangle reads the four texels whose centres are within one
 *     texel of `q`, and each of those squares lies within half a texel of `q`;
 *     `reach` ≥ 1 covers that with room for the float32 page UVs the runtime
 *     stores (`src/atlas.ts`'s header: worst 3.15e-5 texels);
 *   * it keeps the padding the rectangle keeps. A rectangle's cell is the
 *     rectangle grown by `padding`, and this is the hull grown by `padding` —
 *     for a hull that covers its whole drawing, texel for texel the same cell,
 *     which is why such a mesh is placed exactly as a rectangle is;
 *   * it is clipped to the cell, so a region never claims a texel outside the
 *     cell its own pixels are extruded into.
 *
 * ⇒ **Two cells may be placed with their rectangles overlapping exactly when
 * their protected sets share no texel.** For two rectangles that is today's
 * rule — two cells share no texel — so a pack with no mesh region is placed
 * by `rect`'s arithmetic, decision for decision. For any two footprints it
 * means their Chebyshev distance is at least `2 · padding`: if a point of one
 * were within `2 · padding` of a point of the other, the texel under their
 * midpoint would be in both protected sets.
 *
 * ## Exactness — where it rounds, and in which direction
 *
 * The polygons are doubles: a UV as `skeleton.json` states it, times the
 * region's integer size. The set is computed row by row — the band
 * `[row − reach, row + 1 + reach]` against each polygon: every edge clipped to
 * the band, and the polygon's even-odd spans on the band's two lines, which
 * together are the polygon's exact extent inside the band — and every
 * comparison that could decide "outside" is made `FOOTPRINT_SLACK` in the
 * polygon's favour. **The only rounding grows the set**, by at most that slack
 * (1e-6 texels, against a double's 1e-13 on these magnitudes), so it can make
 * two footprints keep further apart than they had to and never lets two
 * touch.

 *
 * What changes is what the free list is the free space OF. `packOnePage`
 * splits it by each placed cell; this splits it by each placed cell's
 * protected set rounded out to bands of `FOOTPRINT_BAND_ROWS` rows
 * (`CellShape.rects`), so a free rectangle may lie inside an earlier cell
 * wherever that cell's region draws nothing. The bands only make the free list
 * coarser — a free rectangle is still clear of every owned texel — and they
 * are what keeps it short: per row, a 60-part set of ellipse hulls packed on a
 * `free` page in over ten minutes; in bands of 8 rows, in 14.9 s against the
 * rectangle pass's 0.6 s, the same page — and with `splitFree`'s sliver drop
 * beside them, in 5.8 s against 2.2 s (a loaded machine). Everything else is
 * MaxRects as `packOnePage` runs it:
 *
 *   * a candidate is a free rectangle that holds the cell's protected set's
 *     bounding box, anchored at its top-left corner — the cell placed so that
 *     box's corner lands there, which may put the cell's own unclaimed
 *     texels over a neighbour's — and whose cell stays on the page;
 *   * the score is Best Short Side Fit over that box, with the same total
 *     tie-break (smallest long-side leftover, then topmost, then leftmost);
 *   * the free list is split and pruned by the same code (`splitFree`), once
 *     per rectangle of the protected set.
 *
 * ⇒ For a cell whose set is the whole cell (`CellShape.whole`), the box IS the
 * cell, the anchor IS the free rectangle's corner and the split IS the cell's:
 * a pack with no mesh region makes `packOnePage`'s decisions one for one
 * (`PK82`).
 *
 * 🔒 **The footprint test is then stated outright rather than trusted to the
 * bookkeeping.** A candidate inside a free rectangle cannot meet a placed set,
 * because no free rectangle overlaps one; every placement is nevertheless
 * checked texel for texel against every set already placed, and a meeting is
 * an internal error, not a placement.
 *
 * It terminates and is deterministic for `packOnePage`'s reasons: one pass
 * over the cells in the caller's order, each over a finite free list, every
 * choice made by a total order, and no input but the cells and the page.

/**
 * Pack these parts onto shared pages.
 *
 * ## Page size
 *
 * `pageSize` is a MAXIMUM, not the size written. Both page edges are powers of
 * two and the pack is tried at every power-of-two pair up to that maximum, in
 * order of increasing area, so a four-part rig gets a 128x64 page rather than a
 * megabyte of transparency. Powers of two are not decoration: `region.x /
 * page.width` is the sampling coordinate every texel is read through, and a
 * power-of-two denominator makes that division exact in binary floating point —
 * which is what keeps a packed region's samples on the same grid as the unpacked
 * page's. With a non-power-of-two page the region origin itself would round, and
 * the one-bit residual described in this file's header would be two roundings
 * deep instead of one.
 *
 * Only when the whole set will not fit one page at the maximum does it spill.
 * **Which parts share a page is then decided at the maximum size** — that is what
 * makes the boundary deterministic — **and each page is written at the smallest
 * power-of-two pair that holds the cells assigned to it** (issue #266). So the
 * rule is the same one either way: the page written is the smallest that holds
 * what is on it. A spill used to write `pageSize x pageSize` for every page,
 * which charged a set that overflowed by one small part a second full page of
 * transparency — 4 MiB of decoded RAM at the 2048 default. A single part whose
 * cell is bigger than the maximum is refused by name — silently splitting one
 * drawing across two pages is not a thing the format can express.
 *
 * ## `pageEdges: 'free'` — a page sized to the parts rather than to a power of two (issue #860)
 *
 * Opt-in, and the default stays `pot`: every runtime accepts a power-of-two page
 * and the editor's own packer writes one by default — 9 of the 10 atlases in the
 * fetched `examples/` corpus are power-of-two on both edges. Under `free` the
 * search is `smallestFreePageFor`: every width from the widest cell up (issue
 * #872; a 32-px grid until then), the height the placement needs, least area
 * first, then squarer, then narrower, with two exact bounds that keep it cheap. Everything
 * else is shared — the MaxRects pass, the packing order, the spill rule (which
 * parts share a page is still decided at `maxEdge x maxEdge`) and `--page-size`
 * as the ceiling on both edges, floored to a power of two exactly as under `pot`.
 *
 * What it buys and what it costs, observed on two 20- and 22-part painting rigs:
 * the page goes from 1024x2048 to 967x1338 (2,097,152 to 1,293,846 texels,
 * -38.3 %) and from 512x2048 to 479x1166 (1,048,576 to 558,514, -46.7 %). Under
 * the 32-px grid #860 shipped with they were 1888x697 (-37.3 %) and 480x1166
 * (-46.6 %). The cost is the exactness the paragraph above describes:
 * `x / pageWidth` is no longer exact, so a REGION attachment's sampling
 * coordinate joins a mesh's at `PK05`'s bound of one least significant bit
 * against the loose build. It does not go past it, and no region's bytes change
 * (`PK02`'s lift-back holds under both).
 *
 * ## `shape: 'polygon'` — rectangles that overlap where nothing is drawn (issue #1099)
 *
 * Opt-in, and the default stays `rect`, which is this function exactly as it
 * was before the option: under `rect` no footprint is computed and every pass
 * is `packOnePage`. Under `polygon` every input carries the footprint its
 * attachments draw (`packFootprints`: a mesh's emitted hull, a region
 * attachment's rectangle), and:
 *
 *   * **what a cell owns** is `footprintCell`'s set — the footprint grown by the
 *     padding, clipped to the cell; two cells may overlap when they own no texel
 *     in common, which between two rectangles is `rect`'s rule and between any
 *     two footprints keeps them `2 · padding` apart (`CellShape`);
 *   * **the placement** is `packOnePageByFootprint`, MaxRects with the free list
 *     split by what each cell owns, run beside the rectangle pass on every page
 *     tried and kept only when it is better (`placePass`) — so a `polygon` page
 *     is never larger than the `rect` page, and a set with no mesh footprint is
 *     placed exactly as under `rect` (`PK82`);
 *   * **the pixels** are drawn in two passes: every cell whole in packing order,
 *     as under `rect`, then every region's owned texels again with its own
 *     values. The owned sets are disjoint, so the second pass's order decides
 *     nothing and every texel a region can sample is its own (`PK79`); a texel
 *     nobody owns carries the last cell drawn over it, which nothing samples.
 *
 * What it costs is measured, not conceded: a region that moves samples through
 * a different `x / pageWidth`, so on the two gallery rigs whose pack moved,
 * 207 and 36 channel samples differ from the `rect` render, every one by 1 —
 * the bit two `rect` packs of the same rig differ by when one is `pot` and one
 * `free` (155 and 44). `--page-edges`, the width search and the spill rule are
 * unchanged.
 *
 * ⚠️ `pot` is not the smaller answer's poor relation, and its search was never
 * "double until it fits": it tries every power-of-two pair in order of area.
 * On both rigs above the cells' own area (1,206,755 and 540,793 texels at
 * padding 2) already exceeds the next power-of-two page down, so no `pot`
 * packer could do better; the only lever left was the power of two itself.

/**
 * One region's drawing, lifted off its page.
 *
 * Two callers, and they are the reason this is a function rather than two loops:
 * the compiler needs a part's own pixel grid when a generator measures the art
 * (a contour mesh traces its alpha), and the selftest needs it to assert that a
 * packed region is a LOSSLESS copy of the loose PNG it came from. One extractor
 * means the proof and the use cannot drift.
 *
 * The result is `originalWidth x originalHeight` — the untrimmed drawing — with
 * the kept rectangle placed at its trim offset and the rest left transparent.
 * `offsetY` is measured from the drawing's BOTTOM (the format's convention) and
 * a plate's rows run downwards, so the kept rectangle's top row is
 * `originalHeight - offsetY - height`.
 *
 * ## A rotated region is MEASURED, not guessed at (issue #570)
 *
 * This refused a rotated region until 2026-09-17, on the argument that the
 * runtime holds "three opinions" about the mapping. Measurement refutes the
 * argument: the three are not three readings of one mapping, they are one
 * mapping and two places that do not implement it.
 *
 *   * `MeshAttachment.computeUVs` (spine-core 4.3.13,
 *     `dist/attachments/MeshAttachment.js:126-162`) is the one routine that
 *     states where a region's texels are for **all four** `degrees`, and it is
 *     the routine `substituteTexture` in [`src/render.ts`](render.ts) already
 *     goes through. The loop below inverts what it samples: `PKR02` asks it,
 *     for every texel of every region of the corpus atlases, which page texel
 *     the runtime samples and compares the lift — 132 regions, 2,848,402
 *     texels, 0 apart, three of them turned (90 twice, 270 once) and each of
 *     those lifting differently with the turn ignored; `PK29` lifts the
 *     packer's fixture at each of 0, 90, 180 and 270 back to its PNG byte for
 *     byte;
 *   * `TextureAtlas`'s `u2`/`v2` (`dist/TextureAtlas.js:164-171`) transpose the
 *     rectangle at 90 and not at 270, so at 270 they describe a rectangle the
 *     page does not have — but `MeshAttachment.computeUVs` never reads them for
 *     an atlas region, and neither does this;
 *   * `RegionAttachment.computeUVs` (`dist/attachments/RegionAttachment.js:156-167`)
 *     assigns the turned corner order at 90 and at nothing else, which is a
 *     region-attachment rendering defect (issue #199) and not a statement about
 *     where the drawing sits.
 *
 * On texel centres — at 90 and 270 measured against the runtime's sampling
 * (`PKR02`), at 180 against the packer fixture's turn (`PK29`) — the mapping
 * puts kept-rectangle pixel `(x, y)` — `x` from the drawing's left, `y` down from `top` — at page
 * pixel `(X + x, Y + y)` unturned, `(X + y, Y + width - 1 - x)` at 90,
 * `(X + width - 1 - x, Y + height - 1 - y)` at 180 and
 * `(X + height - 1 - y, Y + x)` at 270, writing `X`/`Y` for the region's own
 * `x`/`y`; the packed footprint is `height x width` for the two quarter turns
 * and `width x height` for the other two. `repackRotatedTrimmed` in
 * `selftest.ts` derived the same 270 mapping for issue #199's fixture, and had
 * been shipping it green, while this comment claimed the mapping was unknowable.
 *
 * ⚠️ Any other `degrees` takes the unturned branch, because that is what the
 * runtime does with it: `regionFields.rotate` (`dist/TextureAtlas.js:87-93`)
 * `parseInt`s the value without checking it, and `computeUVs` falls to
 * `default:` for everything that is not 90, 180 or 270. Reading such a region
 * unturned is not a guess, it is agreement with the thing that will draw it.
 *
 * rigc's own packer still never rotates (`PACK_NO_ROTATE`), so only a foreign
 * atlas reaches any branch but the first.

 *
 * ⭐ **What a size that disagrees with the file is and is not**, measured rather
 * than assumed (issue #715). `TextureAtlas` computes every region's UVs as a
 * fraction of the DECLARED size — `region.u = region.x / page.width`, spine-core
 * 4.3.13 `dist/TextureAtlas.js:162-171` — `MeshAttachment.computeUVs` takes its
 * `textureWidth` from the same field (`dist/attachments/MeshAttachment.js:125`),
 * `RegionAttachment.computeUVs` reads nothing but `u/v/u2/v2`
 * (`dist/attachments/RegionAttachment.js:152-167`), and `TextureAtlasPage.setTexture`
 * never writes `width`/`height`. So **nothing in the region mapping reads the
 * texture's own size**, and a page whose PNG is the declared page RESCALED is
 * addressed at the same fraction of the picture whatever size the file is:
 * measured on a coordinate-ramp page where every texel names its own position,
 * rigc's own rasteriser drew 116,480 pixels in both and 0 in exactly one at a
 * uniform 0.5.
 *
 * ⇒ That is why this is a clause about **texel** readers rather than about
 * drawing, and why it is nevertheless not renderer policy. Three readers address
 * the page at the coordinates the atlas states, and two of them are rigc's own:
 * `A19`'s alpha scan in [`src/validate.ts`](validate.ts), the region lift
 * `partPlate` traces a mesh generator over in [`src/compile.ts`](compile.ts), and `spine-html`'s region tier, which
 * cuts each part with `drawImage(image, x, y, w, h, …)` and says in its own
 * comment that it tests against the image rather than the `size:` line. Measured
 * on the same page: the lift returned 768 of 768 texels from somewhere else.
 *
 * 🔑 And the format already states coarser texels honestly — `scale:`, which
 * rigc reads (`AtlasPage.scale`) and `--atlas-in` divides by. The same art
 * declared that way builds green and renders identically, so this refusal names
 * a repair the format provides rather than one rigc invented.
