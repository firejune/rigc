/**
 * The rig spec — `"spec": "rigc-rig/1"`. The skeleton as **data**.
 *
 * Until this file existed the bone tree and the slot table were code: three
 * hard-coded formations in `src/archetype.ts`, a slot outside their tables a
 * compile error, and therefore **no skeleton anybody else owns could be stated
 * at all**. That was blocker B1 of [docs/LADDER.md](../docs/LADDER.md), and it
 * gated every rung of the benchmark ladder.
 *
 * ## The vocabulary is Spine's
 *
 * ⭐ Wherever rigc has no better abstraction, this format uses **Spine 4.3's own
 * concept and its own field name, with Spine's own default**, so that an agent
 * that has read Spine's documentation can author a rig here without learning a
 * second vocabulary. `bones[]` is Spine's bone list; `slots[]` is Spine's slot
 * list and its array order is the draw order; `skins` holds Spine's placeholder
 * → attachment maps; `constraints[]` is 4.3's single typed constraint array.
 * Field lists below cite `SkeletonJson.ts` line numbers, which
 * [docs/SPEC_COVERAGE.md](../docs/SPEC_COVERAGE.md) part 1 enumerates in full.
 *
 * Everything rigc adds sits **on top** of that vocabulary and is namespaced so a
 * reader can see where Spine stops:
 *
 * - `from` on a bone — take this bone's setup position from the cut manifest
 *   (an anchor, a part window, a mesh centre) instead of writing a literal that
 *   would drift away from the measured art.
 * - `generator` on a mesh attachment — build the geometry with one of the
 *   builders in `src/mesh.ts` instead of authoring vertex arrays by hand.
 * - `image` on an attachment — name a PNG and let rigc **measure** it, rather
 *   than restating a `width`/`height` that can silently disagree with the file
 *   (SPEC_COVERAGE part 1-6: a missing `width` loads as `NaN`, with no error).
 * - `invariants` — the structural facts skeleton JSON cannot state about itself,
 *   which the validator's archetype assertions read. Nothing in the file says
 *   "this bone carries the cut's axis" or "this parentage is forbidden".
 *
 * ## What a field's PRESENCE means
 *
 * 🔑 **A field is emitted exactly when the spec declares it.** Not "when it
 * differs from the default" — Spine's own exporter omits defaults, but rigc
 * cannot, because a rig may need to say `x: 0` out loud (the overlay formation's
 * handle bone does) and because deciding emission from the *value* makes the
 * emitted file depend on arithmetic rather than on what the author wrote. Omit a
 * field and Spine's default stands; write it and it is in the file. A bone whose
 * position comes `from` the manifest counts as declaring `x` and `y`, because
 * the manifest declared them.
 *
 * ## What this format does NOT own
 *
 * rigc joins three files and each owns a domain:
 *
 * - the **cut manifest** owns measured geometry — crop, part offsets and sizes,
 *   mask polygons, the state machine, anchors, the axis, the measured ceilings;
 * - the **rig spec** (this file) owns skeleton structure — bones, slots, skins,
 *   constraints, and the invariants;
 * - the **motion spec** owns time — named easings, groups, setup pose, the
 *   physics tuning table, and the animations.
 *
 * A cut compiled from all three declares its attachments in the manifest (see
 * `slots` below for the join rule) and leaves `skins` empty. A foreign skeleton
 * with no manifest at all declares them here.

 * that measures against a number nobody wrote down.
 *
 * ⭐ **`width: null, height: null` is the third state: this skeleton declares no
 * stage** (issue #578). Omitting them is silence and stays a refusal by name;
 * stating them `null` is a claim, and the emitted header then carries none of
 * `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` — which is what an editor export of a skeleton whose
 * stage was never set looks like, and what a transcriber of one has to be able

 * else it has one (`RigSlot.attachment` = "show nothing", the cut manifest's
 * `image` = "this cut does not carry the part"), so it is the spelling here too
 * and no new key is introduced: the pair already exists, and only a third value

 * a stated `width` already does: the rig spec is where a claim about the
 * skeleton is made, and the manifest is a record of what the art measured.

  // --- skins: the attachment table, and what the skin ACTIVATES --------------
  //
  // The lists resolve by name like everything else in this format, and the
  // parser is loud about a miss (`Couldn't find bone X for skin Y`) — but in the
  // consumer's process, so they are refused here where the message can name the
  // rig spec. What the parser does NOT check is the pairing with `skin: true`,
  // and that half is silent in both directions (see `RigSkinEntry`).
  //
  // ⭐ **Sets rather than "which skin owns this", because a name may be in
  // several lists.** Until issue #725 these were `name -> the skin that claimed
  // it first`, and a second skin naming the same bone or constraint was refused
  // with *"a bone belongs to one skin"*. The rule was never the parser's and the
  // comment above it said so; what it rested on was that "which skin am I for"
  // has no answer for a name in two lists. It has one, and the runtime gives it:
  // `Skeleton.updateCache` activates the bones of the skin being WORN, so a bone
  // two mutually exclusive variants both list is active under either — measured
  // on a hand-forged file the refusal used to prevent, `bone.active` true under
  // each of the two skins, false under a third that lists nothing and false with
  // no skin set. `Skin.addSkin` deduplicates by object identity, so even a
  // consumer combining both variants gets the bone once. The format is a
  // per-skin SET and rigc now says the same thing.
  //
  // ⚠️ **The worn skin, and only the worn skin.** `updateCache` reads
  // `this.skin` and never `SkeletonData.defaultSkin` — the default-skin fallback
  // is `getAttachment`'s and covers art alone — so a `skin: true` bone that only
  // the `default` skin lists is measured INACTIVE under every other skin and
  // with no skin set. That is why nothing here is a union, and it is the one
  // shape an author is most likely to write expecting "always on".
  //
  // What the rule was really guarding — a second list that was meant to name a
  // different bone — is not derivable from the file, so it is not refused. Every
  // refusal that IS derivable stays: a name the rig does not declare, a name
  // declared under another constraint kind, and both halves of the `skin: true`
  // switch, each of which the rig suite now measures on a shared member.
