/**
 * What a `deform` key does to the geometry, measured once.
 *
 * ⭐ **One survey, two consumers.** `A39_DEFORM_KEEPS_TRIANGLE_WINDING` reads the
 * reversals out of it and refuses a build; `explain`'s `DEFORM` block prints the
 * whole of it and refuses nothing. That split is issue
 * [#296](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/296)'s two halves —
 * [#314](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/pull/314) landed the assertion and
 * [#316](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/issues/316) the report — and the reason
 * they share this file rather than each posing the skeleton themselves is that
 * the report's `winding 32 of 32 kept` and A39's `8 of 32 reverse` are **the same
 * count**. Two derivations of one number drift, and the one that drifts silently
 * is the one nobody exits non-zero on.
 *
 * ## The frame, and why it is the posed one
 *
 * Both sides of every comparison here are taken at the key's OWN time with the
 * animation applied: the deformed mesh against **the same posed bones with the
 * deform cleared**. Holding the bones at setup instead was tried in #314 and is
 * wrong in principle — a weighted mesh's offsets are authored in bone space
 * against the pose they land in, so setup bones measure a pose that never occurs.
 * Sharing the bones between the two sides is also what makes a MIRRORED slot bone
 * a non-event: a negative determinant flips every triangle on both sides and
 * cancels.
 *
 * ⇒ So every ratio on a key is *the deform's own contribution*, and the
 * denominator is 1.000 by construction rather than by measurement. A block that
 * printed `(setup 1.000)` beside it would be printing the definition.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT here
 *
 * **Deformed coverage.** #296 asked for it and it does not exist: `coverage` is
 * rasterised from the attachment's **uvs** against the part's alpha
 * (`measureAuthoredMeshFit`, called from `src/compile.ts`), and a deform moves
 * positions and never uvs. The figure is therefore identical at every key of
 * every timeline, so a `coverage 100.00% (setup 100.00%)` line would be a
 * tautology dressed as a measurement. What actually moves — how much art each
 * drawn pixel now carries — is the stretch below, and `DR04` in `selftest.ts` is
 * the control that says the coverage figure cannot move.
 *
 * ## What the geometry is not enough to say (issue #401)
 *
 * A winding is a claim about **drawn** pixels: A39's own message says the mesh
 * "draws its texture backwards there", and that sentence is false when the slot
 * draws nothing at that time. So each key also carries `draw` — the attachment
 * the slot actually shows and the alpha it shows it at, both read off the same
 * posed skeleton the geometry came from. A key whose `draw.blank` is set is
 * measured and then **passed over by name**: a triangle that draws no pixels
 * cannot draw them backwards. It is per key and per time, never per slot —
 * `invariants.deformMayFold` is the per-slot instrument and it is a declaration,
 * not a measurement.
 *
 * ## And what a key is not enough to say either (issue #403)
 *
 * The keys are where the data is; they are not where the runtime is. Between two
 * of them it interpolates, so a deform inside its fold angle at every key can be
 * past it in between and no key-time measurement looks there. `scanDeformSpan`
 * closes that, and the derivation is in its own comment: the reversal condition
 * over a span has a **closed form** — a quadratic in the interpolation fraction —
 * so the time is solved for rather than searched, and the measurement taken there
 * is this file's ordinary one, at a time no key lands on.
 *
 * ## And WHICH frame, when the animation is never on a track (issue #407)
 *
 * Everything above says *at the key's own time*, and until #407 that meant one
 * thing: the animation played on track 0. An animation a **slider** applies is
 * never played that way — spine-core says so itself, in
 * `SkeletonData.findSliderAnimations`: *"Slider animations are designed to be
 * applied by slider constraints rather than on their own."* The slider picks the
 * time out of a bone property, so **the key's time and the applied time are the
 * same number by construction**; posing the animation on a track while its own
 * slider applies it at the neutral is a frame no playthrough contains, and it
 * reported a fold on a rig that is correct.
 *
 * ⇒ So a deform key is posed at the **reach** its animation actually has
 * (`DeformReach`): on a track when nothing applies it, and otherwise once per
 * slider, with that slider's own mapping inverted and its driving bone moved
 * until the runtime selects this key's time. Inverting the constraint away
 * instead was considered and refused for A39's own reason — a slider's animation
 * may carry bone tracks that move the very bones the offsets are authored
 * against, so dropping it reintroduces "setup bones measure a pose that never
 * occurs" one level up.
 *
 * ⚠️ **What the artifact cannot say, and this therefore does not:** whether a
 * slider's animation is ALSO played on a track somewhere. Nothing in skeleton
 * data records that, so a slider-applied animation is measured in its slider
 * frames only. Two sliders on one animation are two frames and both are measured
 * — one frame's pass never hides another's fold — but a consumer that plays a
 * slider animation on a track as well is outside what this can see.
 *
 * ## Where the halves live (issue #1025, cut 4c-3)
 *
 * Everything above that names no runtime class — the measurements, the
 * survey's interface to its posers, the core's poser and the survey off a
 * model document — is `./deformsurvey.ts`, moved there unchanged so that
 * A39's model-side supplier can reach the survey without reaching spine-core.
 * This file is spine-core's reader and poser and the entries that choose
 * between the two, and re-exports every name it exported before.

/**
 * A fresh skeleton with `skin` worn, which is what every pose below starts from.
 *
 * ## Why a skin, and why this one
 *
 * A deform timeline is keyed on a `skin / slot / attachment` triple, so the mesh
 * it deforms belongs to exactly one skin — and a skeleton nobody dressed shows
 * only what `SkeletonData.defaultSkin` holds. Posing with no skin therefore read
 * a slot that showed **nothing** for every mesh an author had moved into a named
 * skin, and the whole survey then reported the rig as undrawn: `A39` went from
 * PASS to SKIP with a sentence that blamed the rig for what the measurement was
 * doing (issue #583). `placementOf` already recovers which skin holds a
 * timeline's attachment, so the pose can wear it.
 *
 * ## What `setSkin` changes, off the runtime rather than from memory
 *
 * `Skeleton.setSkinBySkin` (spine-core 4.3.13 `Skeleton.js:292-313`) puts the
 * skin's art into each slot's pose and calls `updateCache`, and `updateCache`
 * (`Skeleton.js:142-187`) is where the other two thirds live: a `skinRequired`
 * bone is `active` only if the worn skin lists it, and a `skinRequired`
 * constraint only if `skin.constraints` includes it. Both were measured on this
 * fixture before the repair and both were silent in their own way —
 *
 *  - a slider whose driving bone is skin-required reads a world property that
 *    **nothing moves** while the bone is inactive, so `planDial` found no
 *    responding field, returned `null`, and the animation was reported as
 *    *"played on a track"* — an animation only a slider ever applies;
 *  - a skin-required slider **constraint** is left out of the update cache, so
 *    `SliderPose.time` never leaves its setup value and every key came back as
 *    *"at a time no dial selects"*.
 *
 * Each pose below then calls `setupPose()`, which re-resolves every slot's setup
 * attachment through `Skeleton.getAttachment` — the worn skin first, then
 * `defaultSkin` (`Skeleton.js:335-346`) — so wearing the skin before the pose is
 * the whole of what is needed and nothing has to be re-attached afterwards.
 *
 * ⭐ It takes the `Skin` **object**, not its name. `placementOf` found it by
 * identity, and `findSkin` resolves a name to the FIRST skin that carries it —
 * so a round trip through the name would hand the runtime a different skin on a
 * skeleton that declares two of one name, and there would be nothing in the
 * output to say so. `src/render.ts`'s `skeletonUnderSkin` takes a name because
 * its name came from `--skin` on the command line and refusing an unknown one
 * **by name, with the names that would have worked** is the whole of its job;
 * here there is no name to refuse and no lookup that can fail.
