/**
 * Reading a motion spec — the parse the motion spec did not have.
 *
 * The rig spec has had `parseRigSpec` since it stopped being three hard-coded
 * tables; the motion spec reached `compile` as `readJson<MotionSpec>(path)`, a
 * CAST, so its declared type said what a correct file holds and not what the one
 * on disk does. Issue #307. The compiler's own comment named the consequence out
 * loud, at the one field that had since grown a guard of its own (#293/#303):
 * `setup: { "lid_l": "plate" }` — the attachment name written where its wrapper
 * belongs — compiled **green** and hid the slot, which is the opposite of what
 * was asked and is stated nowhere. That guard is now here, and it now covers
 * every key in the table rather than the ones the emit loop happened to reach.
 *
 * ## What lives here, and what stays in `compile`
 *
 * The split is **shape versus meaning**, and it is a split about what each layer
 * can see rather than a ranking of the checks:
 *
 *   - **here** — is this a number, a string, an array, an object; is a required
 *     field present; is a structure the structure the format describes. Answerable
 *     from the motion file ALONE, which is why it can run at load and why the
 *     rest of the compiler is allowed to assume its inputs from then on.
 *   - **in `compile`** — does this name resolve against the rig spec, is this bone
 *     in that group, does this key's value have the right number of channels for
 *     its property, does this `derive` have a projection onto this axis, is the
 *     last key allowed to carry an easing. Every one of those needs something the
 *     motion file does not contain: the rig, the property table, or the key's
 *     position in its own track.
 *
 * 🚨 **The failure this split is drawn to avoid is two layers refusing one thing
 * under two names**, which makes the error output contradict itself. So a guard
 * the parser makes unreachable was DELETED from `compile` rather than left as a
 * second opinion — the version tag, the `setup` entry shape, the three
 * `non-finite time` guards, the `ik`/`transform`/`deform` array-and-name guards.
 * Where a compile guard is still reachable it stays: `checkKeyTime` still catches
 * a key genuinely past its duration, `rgbaHex` still counts the channels of an
 * `rgba` track key, and the group `v`-map / `derive` refusals (#320,
 * `src/trackgen.ts`) are untouched — every one of them reads the group's member
 * list or the property's projection table, neither of which is in this file.
 *
 * ## Unknown keys ARE refused — issue #545
 *
 * ⚠️ This section said the opposite from 2026-09-03 (#321) until #545: *"a
 * misspelled optional field is therefore still silent — `easing` for `ease`
 * plays linear and says nothing"*, declined because `parseRigSpec` did not refuse one
 * either and one format shrugging while the other refuses is a worse surprise
 * than the stray key. That argument was sound and its premise is now false —
 * `parseRigSpec` refuses by name, so the consistent behaviour is this one. The
 * note's own parenthesis is what made it cheap: the motion specs in this
 * repository carried no undeclared key at any level then and carry none now, so
 * the migration cost, measured over all 39, is zero.
 *
 * `MOTION_KEYS` below is the key set, and the refusal itself is one helper in
 * [`keys.ts`](keys.ts) shared with the rig parser.
