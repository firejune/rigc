/**
 * The render's second poser (issue #968, step 3d of issue #380): the posing
 * seam of `src/render.ts` (`Poser` / `Posed`) implemented over rigc's own
 * core — the compiled model document (`skeleton.model.json`) posed by
 * `src/core/`, each drawn region placed on its page by the document's own
 * `pages` section (issue #1016; a `rigc-compiled/1` document, which has none,
 * by the atlas beside it, read by rigc's own reader `src/atlas.ts`). Nothing
 * here links spine-core, and nothing here is reached
 * from `src/core/`: the core stays pure, and this module is the adapter from
 * its raw entry to the renderer's shapes.
 *
 * ⭐ Why a module of its own rather than a second block in `src/render.ts`.
 * `render.ts` links spine-core (an export's atlas pages and texture
 * substitution, and `spinePoser`), so a core poser written there would share an import list
 * with the runtime it replaces — and "the core poser imports nothing from
 * spine-core" could then only be said, not read off the file. Here it can be:
 * the value imports below are the core, the atlas reader and nothing else, and
 * the one thing taken from `render.ts` is its types (erased at run time). The
 * modules that link spine-core stay three (`CUR07`).
 *
 * ## What each part of a pose is read from
 *
 * - **The walk** is `poseRawAnimation` (`src/core/raw.ts`, issue #966) with
 *   `count` steps of `1/fps` and the reset taken at the animation
 *   (`'animation'`): pose `i` is the running sum of `i` steps, applied at
 *   `min(sum, duration)`, physics reset at pose 0 and stepped by `1/fps` after
 *   — the recipe `spinePoser` runs, measured bit-exact against it on every
 *   frame of the nineteen tree rows by the core suite's `CR03`. The setup pose
 *   is `poseRawSetup`. Since issue #1180 the walk is `poseRawAnimationEach`,
 *   the same walk handing each pose over as it is posed (`CORE_RAW_WALK`), so
 *   one pose is held at a time.
 * - **Vertices, triangles, bones, slot colours, draw order** are the raw
 *   pose's, unchanged: the same doubles `computeWorldVertices`,
 *   `getWorldRotationX` and the slot pose hold (`CR03`).
 * - **The page and page UVs** are `./core/uvs.ts`'s (issue #967): which
 *   region a drawn attachment samples (`drawnRegions` over the pose's `shown`
 *   records and draw order), a region's four UVs (`regionPageUvs`) and a
 *   mesh's (`meshPageUvs`), each held to `sequence.getUVs(index)` at
 *   tolerance 0 on every corpus by `core_gate`'s `uvs` blocks. Where each
 *   region sits — its page, `x`, `y`, turn and the page's size — is the
 *   document's `pages` section (issue #1016, `placementOf`), the atlas `build`
 *   wrote spelled into the document, so a build draws with its `.atlas`
 *   removed.
 * - **The tint** is the slot's light colour times the attachment's colour,
 *   channel by channel, as `src/render.ts`'s `tintOf` forms it; the dark
 *   colour is the slot's, absent where the slot carries none.
 * - **The clip.** Which slot a clip covers is the core's walk
 *   (`./core/clipping.ts`, issue #964), whose rows the raw pose carries with
 *   the attachment's LOCAL UVs. The render samples PAGE UVs, so each clipped
 *   row is cut again with `clipThrough` over the page UVs — the UV rule is
 *   linear in the corner UVs, and the vertices and triangles depend on
 *   positions alone, so the second cut must return the core's vertices,
 *   triangles and verdict to the bit, and a disagreement is thrown as a
 *   defect here rather than drawn. The polygon is the clip slot's world
 *   polygon from the pose's `clips` rows, and the walk that pairs a slot with
 *   the clip over it is the core's rule restated: a clip whose bone is active
 *   starts when none is active, and ends after its end slot is walked.
 * - **A concave or inverse clip** is cut through the core's own convex
 *   decomposition (`clipThrough`, issue #964), and each drawn triangle carries
 *   its source triangle (`clipSourceOf`, `Mesh.source`): the rasteriser
 *   samples it at the source triangle's affine UV, so the pixels are the
 *   spine-core render's whatever pieces either clipper cut (`RC08`). A clip
 *   that is not simple is refused by the raw entry, naming the slot
 *   (`CoreInputError`); the render then falls back to `spinePoser` for that
 *   input and says so (`throughPoser` in `src/render.ts`).
 *
 * ## The skin
 *
 * `--skin <name>` poses `underSkin(doc, name)` — the named skin's record,
 * else the default skin's; the named skin's bones and constraints —
 * measured against spine-core's `setSkin(name)` by the per-skin gate
 * (issue #932). No `--skin` is spine-core's "no skin set" — a fresh skeleton
 * whose `setSkin` was never called — posed as `underNoSkin` (`noSkinView`,
 * issue #1051): no skin's bones or constraints applied, the default skin's
 * included, and every slot resolved through the default skin alone, or
 * through nothing where the document declares skins and no `default` one
 * (`./core/skins.ts`, *No skin set*, for the measurement). Until #1051 it was
 * posed as `underSkin(doc, 'default')`, and the two documents that reading
 * did not cover — a default skin naming a skin-required member, skins with
 * no default one — were refused here and rendered through spine-core.

 * The snapshot of a bone the posed skin leaves UNPOSED — inactive itself (a

 * zero transform, every number `0` (issue #968).
 *
 * ⚠️ "Below an inactive bone" is the half the runtime's flag does not say. A
 * bone that is not skin-required reads `active` true under an inactive parent
 * (measured: `arm` skin-required and unnamed, its child `hand` not
 * skin-required — spine-core reads `arm=false hand=true`), yet its matrix is

 * constraint writes into it. So the predicate is the bone's own flag and every

 *
 * ⭐ Why the seam defines it rather than relaying either runtime. An inactive
 * bone is not posed: neither poser computes its world transform, so its
 * matrix holds whatever a constraint listing it happened to write into a zero
 * matrix. Measured on hand-written rigs under no skin (a skin-required `arm`
 * and its child `hand`, both inactive): a one-bone ik on `hand` left
 * spine-core's matrix at zeros and the core's at NaN; a two-bone ik on `arm,
 * hand` left spine-core's `b` and `d` at `-0` — so `getWorldRotationY` read
 * −179.99999734 (`atan2(−0, …)` at the runtime's pi) — and the core's at `+0`,
 * reading 0; a world transform constraint wrote `worldX` 19.99999979 and a
 * `-0` into both alike. The private corpus met the second case on two rigs:
 * 508 rotation readings of 179.99999734 against 0, every pixel identical. None
 * of those numbers is a pose — a rotation of ±180 is the sign of a zero, and
