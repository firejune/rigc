/**
 * `rig-c/core` — the named entry a player with no Spine runtime poses the
 * model document through (issue #1275).
 *
 * A dependant was observed importing these symbols from the core's own files
 * through the pattern courtesy (`rig-c/src/core/raw`), which RELEASING.md
 * *The import surface* says is not promised. This module re-exports exactly
 * the observed list, so the core's files keep their names and may move: the
 * entry moves with them, and a symbol leaves only as a breaking change.
 *
 * 🔒 It re-exports and does nothing else. What it reaches by value is the
 * core and nothing outside `src/core/` — the core links no `node:` module and
 * no runtime, and its imports of `../model.ts` are type imports — so a bundler
 * targeting a browser takes this entry's closure without a node polyfill.
 * `CUR123` holds the closure, by name; the install smoke bundles it for a
 * browser and holds the bundle to zero `node:` strings.
 *
 * ⚠️ A symbol is listed here only because a dependant was seen using it,
 * or asked for it in writing before it could be (`openTrack`, issue #1276).
 * The list is `scripts/install_smoke.ts`'s `OBSERVED_SYMBOLS` rows for
 * `./core`, and a symbol added here and not there is not promised.
