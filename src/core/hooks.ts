/**
 * The core's hooks for the deform survey (issue #969, step 3e of issue #380):
 * the poses `src/deformmeasure.ts` takes, and what it reads off them, in full
 * doubles — the raw entry's arithmetic (`./raw.ts`) reached at the survey's
 * own seams rather than at a renderer's.
 *
 * The survey poses a skeleton two ways and reads four things off it. Each is
 * an entry here, and each was measured against spine-core 4.3.13 running the
 * survey's own recipe on hand-written documents and on every built row of the
 * tree, at tolerance 0 — every double equal, every float32 equal to the bit
 * (the selftest's `DM` controls; the PR of issue #969 carries the counts). The
 * runtime's source was not read.
 *
 * - **A jump** (`poseJump`) — `deformmeasure.ts`'s `poseAt`: a fresh skeleton,
 *   the setup pose, `update(0)`, `Physics.reset`; then ONE step of `time`
 *   (`AnimationState.update(time)`, `apply`, `Skeleton.update(time)`,
 *   `Physics.update`). It is the raw walk's `setup` reset with one step
 *   (`poseRawAnimation(doc, animation, [time], {}, 'setup')`, measured there),
 *   returning what the walk computes and does not hand out: the world
 *   transforms, the slot rows and every slot's shown record with the deform
 *   array its timelines set.
 * - **A dial** (`poseDial`) — the survey's slider probe: the setup pose with ONE
 *   local field of one bone overridden (`bone.pose[field] = u` after
 *   `setupPose`) or one bone-less slider's time overridden
 *   (`slider.pose.time = u`), `update(0)`, `Physics.reset`. The override is
 *   the pose's, not the setup's: a slider's non-additive blend still reads the
 *   bone's SETUP value (`CoreSliderRecord.setup`), so the view carries the
 *   overridden bone and the slider records keep the ones they were read with.
 *   Two readings come back:
 *   - `read` — the dial's property as `FromProperty.value(skeleton,
 *     bone.appliedPose, local, zeros)` returns it after the whole update (and,
 *     under `local`, after `BonePose.validateLocalTransform`): `sourceValue` in
 *     `./constraints.ts` with no offset, over the solver's LAST state — every
 *     bone's local values as the constraints left them (`applyConstraints`'
 *     `settled`), its world as they left it;
 *   - `applied` — `SliderPose.time` off the applied pose: the time
 *     `sliderTime` computed when the slider ran, before its animation's loop
 *     wrap (`SliderApplication.time`); a slider that did not run (mix 0, or
 *     not active under the skin) keeps its pose's time, the record's `time`
 *     (the override, on a bone-less dial).
 * - **The mesh's world vertices with the slot's deform as posed, cleared, or
 *   replaced** (`meshWorld`) — `VertexAttachment.computeWorldVertices(skeleton,
 *   slot, …)` over the slot's `appliedPose.deform`: an empty array reads the
 *   attachment's own vertices (float32, `worldVertices`' default coords); a
 *   non-empty one IS the vertex array — positions unweighted, offsets added to
 *   each binding's float32 coordinate weighted (`deformedVertices`) — read as
 *   the doubles it holds (`EXACT_COORDS`). The array is the slot's, not the
 *   attachment's: the runtime reads whatever the slot carries, so the posed
 *   array is the one the shown record's timelines set (`ShownGeometry.deform`)
 *   whichever record the vertices are asked of — including another mesh's
 *   array, when the slot shows another mesh that a timeline deforms. That
 *   array is read as the runtime reads it whatever its length: its first
 *   `deformLength` numbers, and NaN past its end (an unweighted mesh reads the
 *   array AS its positions; a weighted one adds it binding by binding) —
 *   measured on a slot switched to a three-vertex mesh while a four-vertex
 *   one's key is asked of it, and on the reverse (`DM02`).
 * - **What a slot shows and at what alpha** (`slotDraw`): the slot row's shown
 *   name and light alpha, the shown record's timeline identity
 *   (`timelineIdentity` in `./deform.ts` — the runtime's
 *   `Attachment.timelineAttachment` compared by record) and its own colour's
 *   alpha on a mesh or linked mesh (1 on anything else, as the survey reads
 *   `shown instanceof MeshAttachment ? shown.color.a : 1`).
 * - **Float32 rows** (`float32Rows`): the survey holds world vertices in a
 *   `Float32Array` (`computeWorldVertices` into one), so the core's doubles are
 *   stored through the same conversion — a store, `Math.fround` per value.
 *
 * ⛔ Nothing is posed that the core would leave out: a construct the raw entry
 * refuses (`./raw.ts`), a block the setup pose leaves absent that the survey
 * reads (bones, slots, the shown records), a record the survey names that the
 * view does not hold — each is a `CoreInputError` naming it, and the survey's
 * seam then says which poser it used and why.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * As the rest of the core: nothing from the Spine runtime package, nothing
 * from `src/transform.ts`, no clock, no randomness, no I/O.
