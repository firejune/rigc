/**
 * Construct 5 of the core, third and fourth cuts (issue #938, step 2e-iii,
 * and issue #956, step 2e-iv, of issue #380): the physics constraint — under
 * `Physics.none`, the oracle's default phase, where it applies nothing, and
 * stepped, `Physics.reset` then `Physics.update` at a fixed `dt`, where it
 * integrates.
 *
 * ## What an unstepped physics constraint contributes: nothing
 *
 * Measured by posing hand-written skeletons through `tools/pose_oracle.ts
 * dump` (spine-core 4.3.13, `--skin all`, `--physics none`) twice — once as
 * written, once with every physics constraint and every physics timeline
 * taken out — and comparing the two dumps at tolerance 0:
 *
 * - 400 one-constraint skeletons: the constrained bone in all five inherit
 *   modes under a reflecting, sheared, scaled parent, with amplifier bones ten
 *   thousand units out along its axes; each of the five components (`x`, `y`,
 *   `rotate`, `scaleX`, `shearX`) at 1, between 0 and 2 or negative; `limit`,
 *   `fps`, `inertia`, `strength`, `damping`, `mass`, `wind`, `gravity` and
 *   `mix` at random, each `…Global` flag at random; half of them with
 *   physics timelines keying `mix`, `wind` and `reset` in an animation that
 *   also swings the parent — sampled at seven `grid` or `irr` times, every
 *   sample posed on the ONE skeleton the dump reuses: **400 of 400
 *   identical**.
 * - 462 nine-bone rigs whose two to six constraints mix physics constraints
 *   with ik and world- and local-space transform constraints in random order
 *   (so a physics constraint sits between a world-space edit and a constraint
 *   that re-poses it), physics timelines keying `mix` and `inertia`, five
 *   `irr` samples: **462 of 462 identical**, 41,577 bone-samples.
 *
 * So under `Physics.none` the physics constraint neither moves its bone nor
 * re-poses anything below it, whatever its parameters, its `mix` or its
 * timelines, and wherever it stands in the update order: `applyConstraints`
 * is given no step context and applies nothing.
 *
 * ## The stepped phase, measured (issue #956)
 *
 * Every rule below was fixed the same way: hand-written skeletons dumped by
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts dump --physics step --dt <s>` (spine-core 4.3.13) and
 * by the core, compared at tolerance 0, most with amplifier bones ten
 * thousand units out so a difference of 1e-10 in a matrix reads as a grid
 * step. spine-core's source was not read; each rule is the reading the dump
 * left exact, and each is stated with the population that fixed it and the
 * readings it rejected. The figures `n of 400` below are one population
 * (seed 81 of the lab): 400 rigs of six bones under one to five constraints —
 * physics with every component, setting, `…Global` flag and timeline at
 * random, ik and transform among them, skin-required constraints, two
 * animations, `dt` among 1/60, 1/30, 1/120 and a random 0.005–0.05 — exact
 * on 400 of 400 (63,982 bone-samples) under the rules as written, and the
 * count is how many stayed exact with ONE rule replaced by the reading named.
 * The core suite's `CK` controls hold the probes.
 *
 * **Defaults.** A field the record leaves out reads the parser's value, read
 * off the oracle's `physics` block for a constraint stating nothing: every
 * component 0, `limit` 5000, `fps` 60 (`step` = 1 / fps: 45 read 0.022222),
 * `inertia` 0.5, `strength` 100, `damping` 0.85, `mass` 1 (the block holds
 * `massInverse`: 3 read 0.333333), `wind`, `gravity` 0, `mix` 1, every flag
 * false, `scaleY` `None`. The core writes that block from its records
 * (`physicsRows`), under both phases.
 *
 * **The schedule** (`stepSchedule`) is the oracle's, from its header: a
 * fresh state per animation, the animation applied at 0 and the skeleton
 * reset; then from each sample's predecessor `p`, a step to `p + k·dt` while
 * that is before `t`, then to `t`. The skeleton's clock is the SUM of the
 * steps' deltas (`s − previous s`), not `s`: the constraint reads its delta
 * off that clock. The setup pose under the step is the reset pose. Each step
 * applies the animation from the time the walk last applied it at
 * (`PhysicsStepContext.last`, −1 before the first), as a player does — which
 * decides only when a `reset` key fires (*reset*, below).
 *
 * **Which constraints step.** A constraint on an inactive bone does not. A
 * constraint with `skin: true` steps exactly when an applied skin's
 * `constraints.physics` list names it — under `--skin all` every skin is
 * applied at once, under `--skin <name>` the named skin alone
 * (`listedBySkin`, set per skin view by `underSkin` in `./index.ts`;
 * `physicsActive`). Measured on the
 * commander's private-corpus finding (two rows DIFF, the core leaving such
 * constraints inert): hand-written documents dumped under `--physics step`
 * with `--skin all`, `--skin s1` and `--skin default` — named by no skin:
 * not stepped under any; named by `s1`: stepped under `all` and `s1`, not
 * under `default`; named by the default skin: stepped (under `all`, and —
 * issue #932 — under `default` but not under `s1`); a skin naming the
 * constrained bone (skin-required or not), another physics constraint or an
 * ik constraint, but not this one: not stepped; no skins at all: not
 * stepped. The reading inherited from issue #938 — `skin: true` is never
 * applied under `--skin all` — was measured under `Physics.none`, where a
 * physics constraint applies nothing either way; it is rejected (`CK13`
 * plants it and turns the listed probe red). A
 * constraint whose `mix` is 0 does nothing at all at that update — not even
 * read its clock: a constraint muted from 0 to 0.3 s and then keyed to 1
 * integrates the whole 0.3 s on its first live update after the pending one
 * (sack-pro's `fall-in`; advancing the clock at `mix` 0 kept 394 of 400). A
 * constraint never updated is pending, like a reset one: its first update
 * takes the bone where it is and integrates nothing (not pending kept 399 of
 * 400 and turned sack-pro red).
 *
 * **The components.** Each is on when it is ABOVE 0: `x`, `y`, `scaleX`, and
 * the rotation when `rotate` or `shearX` is (reading any non-zero as on kept
 * 279 of 400). A negative `rotate` or `shearX` still weighs the rotation: its
 * weight is `(rotate + shearX)·mix` (dropping the negative kept 369 of 400).
 *
 * **The step** (`stepPhysics`), in the order measured. `reset` clears every
 * offset, velocity and lag, zeroes what remains and sets the constraint's
 * clock to now; it is also what a `reset` key does, while the animation is
 * applied — before the step's delta is added. Then:
 *
 * - `delta` is the clock since the constraint last read it (never below 0),
 *   added to what remains. A pending constraint takes the bone's origin as
 *   the one it follows and integrates nothing; what remains is kept.
 * - `x`, `y`: the offset gains `(previous origin − origin)·inertia`, held to
 *   `±limit·delta`. Then while at least one fixed `step` remains: `velocity
 *   += (wind·R − offset·strength)·massInverse·step` (`y`: `−= (gravity·R +
 *   offset·strength)·…`), `offset += velocity·step`, `velocity *=
 *   damping^(60·step)` (`damping` itself kept 268 of 400; exact at 60 fps,
 *   where the exponent is 1), and one step is taken off. What remains is
 *   carried to the next update (dropping it kept 116 of 400; integrating once
 *   per update at `dt` in place of `step` kept 116).
 * - The offset shown is `offset − lag·(1 − remaining/step)` (at least 0),
 *   `lag` the change the integration just made: the pose between two fixed
 *   steps (showing the integrated offset kept 116 of 400). The bone's origin
 *   moves by it times `mix` times the component.
 * - Rotation and shear follow the bone's tip: with `ca` the bone's x-axis
 *   angle and `(dx, dy)` how far its origin moved since the last update (each
 *   held to `±limit·delta`), the offset gains `atan2(dy + ty, dx + tx) − ca −
 *   (offset − lag·z₀)·w`, brought into (−π, π] with the runtime's π
 *   (3.1415927: `Math.PI` kept 369 of 400), times `inertia` — `(tx, ty)` the
 *   tip `length·(a, c)` the last update left, `w` the weight above, and `z₀`
 *   the SHOWN weight of the previous update: `1 − remaining/step` before
 *   this update's delta is added (after it kept 177 of 400; no lag at all
 *   kept 176). The spring then runs as for `x` with `−((wind·sin + gravity·
 *   cos)·length/R + offset·strength)·massInverse` — `sin`, `cos` of the
 *   shown angle, re-read after every step.
 * - `scaleX` follows the tip along the bone: the offset gains `(dx·cos +
 *   dy·sin)·inertia / r`, `r = length·|x column|`, and springs with `(wind·cos
 *   − gravity·sin − offset·strength)·massInverse`. ⚠️ With no rotation on,
 *   `r` is `length·|x column| − lag·z₀` — a dimensionless lag taken from a
 *   length. It is the measured reading, not a derived one: the plain `r`
 *   left scale-only probes off by a relative `(inertia step)·lag/length`
 *   (`1 − 0.00020008` on a 50-unit bone moved one unit a step, `5e-5` at 100
 *   units, `8e-4` at 25), and the subtraction made them exact (the plain `r`
 *   kept 357 of 400; with rotation on the plain `r` is the exact one).
 * - Applied last: the rotation `o = (offset − lag·z)·mix` turns both columns
 *   by `o·rotate`; with `shearX` on, the y column turns by `o·rotate` and
 *   the x column by `o·(rotate + shearX)` (the first reading turned the y
 *   column for the shear and read 0.049 off). The x column is scaled by `1 +
 *   (offset − lag·z)·mix·scaleX`. The tip `length·(a, c)` is kept for the next
 *   update.
 * - After it the bone is a world edit, as a world-space transform constraint
 *   leaves one: its local values read back (`localFromWorld`) and every bone
 *   below it posed again — so a constraint whose components are all 0 but
 *   whose `mix` is not still re-derives its bone.
 *
 * **referenceScale.** `R` above is the skeleton's `referenceScale`. A Spine
 * header stating 50 moved 30 of 50 wind-and-gravity probes, and moved none
 * without them. The model document states it (`referenceScale`, issue
 * #958): `readModel` refuses a document without it by name and stamps it on
 * every physics record (`CorePhysicsRecord.referenceScale`), which is what
 * the step reads. Until #958 the core read the parser's 100 as a constant.
 *
 * ## The timelines
 *
 * `inertia`, `strength`, `damping`, `mass`, `wind`, `gravity` and `mix`
 * keys, one channel each, construct 4's key search and curves (key times and
 * values float32), applied in the animation's order. Before the first key
 * the setup value; after it `setup + (value − setup)` — the blend at alpha 1,
 * not the value itself: the two differ by a unit in the last place, and a
 * mass probe (a parent thrown 3e11 units) and a two-constraint wind-and-mix
 * probe both read it (the value itself kept 400 of 400 in the population and
 * turned both probes red). A `mass` key states a mass: the pose holds
 * `1 / (m₀ + (value − m₀))`, `m₀ = 1 / massInverse`. A key omitting its
 * value reads 0, a `mix` key 1 (`docs/AUTHORING.md` §4.4; a first key with
 * no value, on each of the seven, read exact — the `mass` one NaN in both
 * dumps). The timeline that
 * names no constraint (`*`) writes every active constraint whose `…Global`
 * flag for that value is on, and resets every active constraint.
 *
 * **reset.** A `reset` key resets its constraints on the step whose apply
 * crosses it — a key in `(last, t]`, `last` the time the walk last applied
 * the animation at, −1 before the first (`resetCrossed`) — so once, as a
 * player crosses it (issue #960, measured against `Animation.apply(last,
 * t)` and against `AnimationState` with one track, which agreed to the bit:
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts` §`--physics step`). Until issue #960 the oracle
 * applied the animation from 0 at every step, and this walk mirrored it: a
 * key reset its constraints at EVERY step from it on, holding the rig still
 * (ignoring the key, or firing it once, kept 278 of 400 under that
 * oracle). That
 * reading is rejected as a schedule no player runs; the core suite's `SC`
 * controls plant it and turn the probe red on the steps after the key.
 *
 * ## What is not exact, and why
 *
 * Over 3,000 random rigs of three shapes (all five inherit modes; ik and
 * transform among them; skin-required constraints; the timeline naming no
 * constraint) the step read exact on 2,986. The fourteen: three are wrong
 * under `--physics none` too (a transform collapsing its bone's scale, and
 * no step involved); one is a bone under an inactive parent, whose zero
 * matrix both dumpers take to NaN by different routes; the other ten are
 * last-bit differences upstream of the step, amplified by it — seven on a
 * bone in `noScale`, `noScaleOrReflection` or `noRotationOrReflection`,
 * whose world transform `./world.ts` reproduces to the grid but not to the
 * bit (a probe amplified a billion units read one of those modes a few
 * units in the last place on 61 of 61 samples, and the four other modes on
 * none), two after `localFromWorld` re-derived a bone the step then moves
 * again, and one under a constraint whose rotation weight is negative, where
 * the inertia pushes away and any difference grows. Each is exact with the
 * bones normal, or with the weight positive. The step itself holds no
 * residual found.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * As the rest of the core: nothing from the Spine runtime package, nothing
 * from `src/transform.ts`, no clock, no randomness, no I/O.
