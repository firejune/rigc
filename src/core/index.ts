/**
 * rigc's own core: it reads the compiled model as `build` writes it
 * (`rigc-compiled/3`, and `/2` before issue #1026 and `/1` before issue #1016;
 * `skeleton.model.json`)
 * and poses it (issue #925, step 2a
 * of issue #380). It is the second dumper `tools/pose_oracle.ts` was shaped
 * for: what it poses is written into the same `pose-oracle/2` document the
 * runtime's dump is, and `compare` holds the two to each other.
 *
 * ## What it poses, and what it does not yet
 *
 * Three constructs are here, in the runtime's own order (§5 of the design on
 * issue #380): **the setup pose of every bone** — its world origin and matrix,
 * its active flag and its parent (issue #925) — **the slots at the setup
 * pose** — what each shows, its colour and dark colour, the region path
 * the shown attachment names (issue #928, below) and its blend mode (issue
 * #933) — and **every drawn
 * attachment's world vertices at the setup pose** — a region's corners, a
 * mesh's vertices and a clipping polygon (issue #931, `./vertices.ts`, whose
 * header states each measured rule). All are rounded as the oracle rounds
 * (`gridRound`). A fourth, **every animation's bone and slot timelines at the
 * oracle's sample times** (issue #936), is its own module, `./animation.ts`,
 * which this reader calls for each animation record. Its remainder (issue
 * #955) — the draw order at setup and at a sample (`./draw_order.ts`), the
 * deform and sequence timelines, which move what the attachments and clips
 * draw at setup (under a slider) and at a sample (`./deform.ts`), and the
 * events a sample fires (`./events.ts`) — is posed too. With the physics
 * parameters (issue #956, `./constraints_physics.ts`) no block of the
 * oracle's document is left: `NOT_ADMITTED` is empty. The `clipped` block
 * (issue #964, `./clipping.ts`) — the triangles drawn under a clip, as the
 * runtime's clipper returns them — is posed at setup and at every sample,
 * and left out by name where a clip that is not strictly convex, or an
 * inverse one, starts.
 *
 * **Constraints (construct 5, issue #938, `./constraints.ts`).** The oracle
 * poses the setup pose with every constraint applied, so a bone a constraint
 * moves is not where its hierarchy alone puts it. The core applies the ik,
 * transform, path, physics and slider constraints in the document's order
 * after the hierarchy, as the runtime's update order does (`./constraints.ts`'s
 * header states it with its measurements, `./constraints_path.ts`'s the
 * path's; a physics constraint under `Physics.none` applies nothing, and
 * under the stepped phase — `poseSetup`'s `physics` context, the reset —
 * integrates, `./constraints_physics.ts`, whose `poseSteppedAnimations`
 * walks the oracle's `--physics step` schedule; a slider applies an animation,
 * `./constraints_slider.ts`); a path the core cannot pose exactly (skins
 * that disagree over the curve it walks) leaves the setup bones out naming
 * it (`constraintsAbsentWhy`). Before issue #938, measured over the nineteen
 * recipes `tools/emit_hashes.ts` generates: seven declared a constraint, and
 * on each the runtime's setup pose differed from the hierarchy's alone; all
 * seven read IDENTICAL now. The `paths` and `pathAttachments` blocks — each
 * path constraint's settings and each path attachment's flags and
 * `lengths`, as the runtime reads them — are written from the model
 * (`pathRows`, `pathAttachmentRows`).
 *
 * 🔸 **Active** is measured rather than assumed. Posed through the runtime by
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts dump` on a hand-written skeleton (issue #925's
 * report; held by the core suite's `CO07`): a bone that is not skin-required
 * is active; a skin-required bone is active exactly when the applied skin
 * names it or names a bone below it — a skin-required parent of a named bone
 * is active, and a bone that is not skin-required stays active under an
 * inactive parent. The oracle's `--skin all` applies every skin at once, so
 * under it `active` means: not skin-required, or named — itself or a bone
 * below it — by ANY skin's `bones` list. Under `--skin <name>` (issue #932,
 * `underSkin`) it is the named skin's list alone — the default skin's does
 * not count (`./skins.ts`, measured). An inactive bone is not posed
 * (`worldTransforms` in `./world.ts`).
 *
 ## The slots at the setup pose (issue #928)
 *
 * Every rule below was measured by posing a hand-written skeleton through
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts dump` (spine-core 4.3.13, `--skin all`) and reading
 * the slot rows it printed; the core suite's `CO11` holds the same skeleton
 * against the core at tolerance 0.
 *
 * - **Which attachment a slot shows.** A slot whose setup placeholder is
 *   `null` shows nothing (`null`). Otherwise the placeholder is looked up in
 *   every skin; one skin filling it — the default or a named one alone —
 *   shows that record. A placeholder no skin fills shows nothing: the row
 *   reads `null` for the attachment and for the path, not the placeholder's
 *   name.
 * - ⚠️ **Several skins filling one placeholder: the LAST in the Spine FILE's
 *   skin order wins — and the model does not hold that order.** Three skins
 *   filling one placeholder with three names, in three file orders
 *   (`default, s1, s2`; `s2, s1, default`; `s1, default, s2`), showed `s2`,
 *   `default` and `s2`'s name: the last one listed, every time — the oracle's
 *   `--skin all` merges the skins in file order, a later one replacing an
 *   earlier one's entry. The file's order is not the model's: the Spine
 *   emitter writes `default` first and the rest in the editor's order
 *   (`editorSkinOrder` in `src/compile.ts`), so a rig built with skins
 *   `default, zulu, alpha` has a model listing them so and a file listing
 *   `default, alpha, zulu`; with `zulu` and `alpha` filling one placeholder,
 *   spine-core showed `zulu`'s attachment, and "last in the model's order"
 *   would have shown `alpha`'s (measured through `ingest` and `build`; the
 *   core suite's `CO12` builds it). That order is a Spine spelling the model
 *   rightly does not carry (census §4's class), so the core does not guess it:
 *   where every skin filling a slot's setup placeholder gives the same row —
 *   the same shown name and path — the order cannot matter and the row is
 *   posed; where they differ, the whole `setup.slots` block is absent, naming
 *   the slot, the placeholder and the skins. Posing one skin at a time
 *   (`--skin <name>`, `underSkin`, issue #932) has no order to know — the
 *   named skin's record, else the default skin's (`./skins.ts`) — so the
 *   per-skin dumps judge what the merged view leaves out, and
 *   `tools/core_gate.ts` runs one per skin on a row declaring several.
 * - **The name shown** is the record's own `name` where the model states one,
 *   else the placeholder: a region filed under `p` with `path: "other"` shows
 *   `p`; one stating `name: "n"` shows `n`.
 * - **The region path** is the record's `path` where stated, else the name
 *   shown — for a region, a mesh and a linked mesh (a region stating
 *   `name: "n"` and no path reads path `n`; a linked mesh stating
 *   `path: "lm"` reads `lm`; a region or mesh with a `sequence` reads its
 *   stated `path` as written, `seq` and not a numbered frame). A bounding
 *   box, a clipping polygon and a path attachment read `null`, as does a
 *   point, which rigc does not emit.
 * - **Colour.** No colour stated reads `1, 1, 1, 1`. A stated colour reads
 *   each channel as its two hex digits over 255 (`ff800040` reads
 *   `1, 0.501961, 0, 0.25098`; upper case reads the same); six digits read
 *   an alpha of 1. The attachment's own colour does not enter the slot's row
 *   (a region tinted `00000080` under an unstated slot colour read white).
 *   Every one of the 256 byte values in every channel is held by `CO11`.
 * - **Dark colour** is `null` when the slot states none, else its first
 *   three channels read the same way; eight digits read the same three, the
 *   fourth unread.
 * - 🚫 **Any other spelling is refused by `readModel`, by name.** The
 *   runtime's reading of one is not a colour: `ff80004` (seven digits) read
 *   alpha 1, `zz800040` read a red of NaN, `f` read red 0.058824 and green
 *   NaN, and an empty colour read white while an empty dark colour read none.
 *   Reproducing that would be copying a parser's accidents, not posing a slot.
 * - **A slot on an inactive bone still shows its attachment** (a slot on a
 *   skin-required bone no skin names read its region and path).
 * - ⚠️ **A slider poses slots at setup; the other four constraint kinds do
 *   not.** A slider applies an animation, and the oracle's setup applies
 *   constraints: a hand-written slider whose animation keys a slot's `rgba`
 *   to `ff000080` and its attachment to `q` turned that slot's setup row from
 *   `r, 1, 1, 1, 1` to `q, 1, 0, 0, 0.501961`, with its dial bone and without
 *   one. Issue #928 left `setup.slots` absent wherever a slider keys a slot;
 *   since issue #938 each slider's slot timelines are applied after the
 *   bones, in constraint order, at the time and mix it was applied with
 *   (`applySliderSlots` in `./constraints_slider.ts`, which states the blend).
 *   The slots are still absent, naming the slider, where the bones its time
 *   is read from are absent. An ik, transform, path or physics constraint
 *   moves bones only.
 * - **The blend mode** (issue #933) is the row's last cell, as the runtime's
 *   enum names it: `Normal`, `Additive`, `Multiply`, `Screen`. A slot that
 *   states none reads `Normal`. The runtime reads a stated blend by
 *   upper-casing its first letter and looking the result up: `additive` and
 *   `Additive` both read `Additive`, while `ADDITIVE` and `mUlTiPlY` read no
 *   mode at all (the dump's `null`) and an empty string threw on load. So the
 *   core reads exactly the eight spellings whose first letter folds to one of
 *   the four names and `readModel` refuses every other by name. The mode is
 *   the slot's data, not its pose: an animation keying the slot's colour left
 *   it where setup put it, so a sample's row carries the setup's mode.
 *
 * ## The evaluator
 *
 * World transforms come from the core's own evaluator, `worldTransforms` in
 * `./world.ts`, written from what a bone's fields mean and from measurement
 * against the runtime's dump; its header states each measured choice. It is
 * not reached through `src/transform.ts`'s `computeWorldTransforms`: that is
 * the compiler's adapter over this same evaluator (issues #1015 and #1021 —
 * the same arithmetic since #1021), and the core importing the compiler would
 * be a cycle. The compiler's evaluator before #1015, called as it was, read
 * IDENTICAL on 1 of the 12 recipes the core poses (DIFF on 11, worst 61
 * millionths against a tolerance of one — issue #925's report). The owner's
 * decision is recorded on issue #380. `poseSetup` takes a
 * `CorePlant` — the evaluator, the skin resolution, the colour and blend readings — so
 * the suite's plants can pass a copy of one of them; nothing else passes one.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * `src/` is pure and this directory is held to it by the core suite's tree
 * rule (`selftest.ts`, band `CO`): no clock, no randomness, no network, no
 * child process, no file system — `readModel` takes the document's TEXT — and
 * nothing from the Spine runtime package, as a value or as a type.
