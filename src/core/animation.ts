/**
 * Construct 4 of the core (issue #936, step 2d of issue #380): an animation's
 * bone and slot timelines at a sample time — the key search, the curve as the
 * runtime evaluates it, and every bone and slot timeline kind — posed on the
 * setup pose with the animation alone at full weight, the way the oracle
 * samples one (`tools/pose_oracle.ts`, *How a pose is posed*: the setup pose,
 * then the animation applied at `t` with alpha 1 from the setup pose, then the
 * world transforms).
 *
 * Every rule below was measured by posing a hand-written skeleton through
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts dump` (spine-core 4.3.13) and reading the rows it
 * printed; nothing here was written from the runtime's source. The core
 * suite's `CA` controls hold the same skeletons against the core at tolerance
 * 0, and `tools/core_gate.ts` holds every recipe of the tree's corpus.
 *
 * ## The key search
 *
 * A timeline's value at `t` comes from the LAST key whose time is at or
 * before `t`. Measured on a `translatex` keyed at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 on a bone at
 * setup `x` 5, sampled on a grid of quarter seconds over 2 s:
 *
 * - **Before the first key the channel is at its setup value** — `x` read 5
 *   at 0 and 0.25. ⚠️ Not "untouched": the timeline POSES the setup value. A
 *   bone keyed by `translate` (0 → 10, 2 → 20) and by a `translatex` whose
 *   first key is at 1 read `x` = setup (1, not 11) before 1 when `translatex`
 *   is listed after `translate`, and 11 when it is listed before — each
 *   timeline, in the animation's order, writes its channels at every time.
 * - **On a key exactly, that key** — a stepped key at 0.5 (value 10) followed
 *   by a key at 1 (value 30) read 30 at t = 1, not 10.
 * - **At and after the last key, the last key's value** — 45 (setup 5 + 40)
 *   at 1.5, 1.75 and 2.
 * - Key times are compared as the runtime stores them, float32
 *   (`Math.fround`), against the sample time as a double; key values are read
 *   as float32 too. A linear segment from (0, 0) to (0.4666667, 100000)
 *   sampled at `off` read 12500, 37500, 62500, 87500 exactly — the key time
 *   and the duration both the float32 0.46666669845581055; the double
 *   0.4666667 would have read 4.1e-5 to 2.9e-4 higher.
 *
 * ## The three curves, per segment
 *
 * A key's `curve` shapes the segment from it to the next key.
 *
 * - **None — linear**: `v0 + (t − t0) / (t1 − t0) · (v1 − v0)`, per channel.
 * - **`stepped`**: the key's own value until the next key's time.
 * - **Bézier** — four absolute numbers per channel, `cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2`, the
 *   two handles of the cubic from `(t0, v0)` to `(t1, v1)` (the format's
 *   documentation: a curve's control points are in the timeline's own time and
 *   value). ⭐ **The runtime does not evaluate the cubic.** Posed on one bone,
 *   one `translatex` from (0, 0) to (1, 1000) with handles (0.1, 800) and
 *   (0.3, 1000), 2,000 `dense` samples read BELOW the exact cubic solved for
 *   `t` at every interior sample, by up to 10.34 — the residual of chords
 *   under a concave curve — and the slopes between consecutive samples fall
 *   into exactly ten runs whose nine intersections are the cubic's points at
 *   the parameter `u = 0.1, 0.2, …, 0.9` (to the fourth decimal of `t`). So
 *   the curve is the POLYLINE through the key, the cubic's nine points at
 *   tenths of its parameter, and the next key, and a sample is interpolated
 *   linearly on the piece whose end is the first point at or after `t`.
 *
 *   **The nine points, to the last float32 step.** They are stored float32,
 *   and which float32 each lands on was fixed by two measurements, both with
 *   the samples of spine-core's dump as the judge at the oracle's rounding:
 *
 *   1. *The recurrence.* Over 60 random segments whose every number was
 *      already a float32 (82,731 samples), the cubic's tenths evaluated
 *      directly missed 866 samples: each miss a point one float32 step off,
 *      where the exact double lay within a few hundredths of a step of a
 *      rounding midpoint — so the runtime's points carry a relative error
 *      near 1e-9 before the rounding. Forward differencing the cubic at the
 *      step h = 1/10 (the textbook recurrence: each point the previous plus a
 *      first difference, which grows by a second, which grows by a third)
 *      reproduces that error exactly when the third difference's one-sixth
 *      is the eight-digit decimal `0.16666667`: 0 misses. With 1/6 exact it
 *      missed 867, with 1/6 as a float32 1,694; a recurrence whose running
 *      sums are float32 missed more than any.
 *   2. *The numbers it runs on.* Over 300 of the 8,145 Bézier channel
 *      segments in the 19 recipes' bone timelines, each re-posed alone
 *      (18,430 samples), the recurrence above missed 4,145 samples when run
 *      on the key times, values and handles as float32 — and 0 when run on
 *      the numbers AS THE FILE STATES THEM (the doubles its text parses to),
 *      with only the polyline's two ends, the keys themselves, float32. The
 *      mixed readings missed 2,479 (handles stated, keys float32), 2,587
 *      (keys stated, handles float32) and 1,054 (the ends stated too). The
 *      first population could not tell these apart because its numbers were
 *      float32 to begin with; the model's numbers are float32 SHORTEST NAMES
 *      (`f32` in `src/compile.ts`), whose doubles are not the float32 itself.
 *
 *   So a key keeps both (`CoreKey.stated` and its float32 `time`/`values`),
 *   and `bezierPolyline` is the recurrence over the stated numbers. The core
 *   suite's `CA02` holds the measurement and every rejected reading missing.
 *
 * ## The bone timelines — alpha 1 from the setup pose
 *
 * Measured on bones with non-trivial setup values:
 *
 * - `rotate` ADDS to the setup rotation: setup 20, keys 350 → 10 read a world
 *   x axis at 10° at t = 0 and at 200° (−160°) half way — the value is
 *   interpolated as a number, 350 → 10 passing 180, and never wrapped to the
 *   short way round.
 * - `translate`, `translatex`, `translatey` ADD to the setup position.
 * - `scale`, `scalex`, `scaley` MULTIPLY the setup scale: setup (2, 0.5) and a
 *   key (3, 1) read (6, 0.5); a negative key or setup multiplies through
 *   (setup −2, keys −1 → 3 read 2 → −6 through 0).
 * - `shear`, `shearx`, `sheary` ADD to the setup shear.
 * - `inherit` sets the bone's inherit mode, stepped by the format: before its
 *   first key the setup mode, from each key that key's mode (measured
 *   `normal → onlyTranslation → normal` under a rotated, scaled parent).
 *
 * The posed values replace the setup values in a copy of the bone and the
 * core's own evaluator (`worldTransforms`, `./world.ts`) poses the copies.
 *
 * ## The slot timelines
 *
 * - `attachment`: stepped by nature; before its first key the setup
 *   attachment, from a key its placeholder, resolved exactly as the setup
 *   placeholder is (`shownAttachment`), a placeholder no skin fills and a
 *   `null` name both showing nothing.
 * - `rgba`, `rgb`, `alpha`, `rgba2`, `rgb2` SET the channels they name (they do
 *   not add to or scale the setup colour) and leave every other channel at
 *   setup: `rgb` keeps the setup alpha, `alpha` the setup rgb; `rgba2` and
 *   `rgb2` set the dark colour too. A key's hex pair reads as its byte over 255
 *   and is stored float32, as every key value is.
 * - **Every colour channel is clamped to [0, 1] after the curve**: an `rgba`
 *   whose green curve dips below 0 and whose red curve rises above 1 read 0
 *   and 1 there.
 * - 🚫 **`rgba2` or `rgb2` on a slot with no dark colour is refused.** Posed
 *   through the runtime, such a timeline throws while the animation is
 *   applied (`TypeError`), so no dump exists to hold a core to; the compiler
 *   refuses the same timeline before any file is written (`compileTrack`).
 *
 * ## The duration and the sample times
 *
 * The oracle's sample times are the tool's formula (`sampleTime`, which the
 * tool calls here, as it rounds with `gridRound`), over the runtime's
 * duration of the animation: the LAST key time of every timeline in it — the
 * later constructs' (constraints, deform, sequence, draw order, events)
 * included — as float32, not the model's declared `duration`. Measured: a
 * rotate ending at 1 beside an event at 2.5, the model stating 0, sampled over
 * 2.5 in spine-core's dump (`CA09`); over the 54 animations of the 19 recipes,
 * every duration agreed.
 *
 * ## What is left out, by name
 *
 * The constraints are applied after the timelines, posed by their own
 * timelines at `t` (issue #938, `./constraints.ts`), and each slider's slot
 * timelines after the sample's own (`./constraints_slider.ts`); a document
 * whose setup bones are absent has no animation bones from the core, for the
 * same reason, and neither has one whose animation keys the attachment of a
 * walked path's slot, deforms a walked path whose placeholder several skins
 * fill, or whose path offset reads a slot bone from the previous pose that
 * changes its reflection (`./constraints_path.ts`); a slider whose animation
 * keys a slot on such a document, or a placeholder skins fill differently,
 * leaves the animation slots out as they leave the setup slots out.
 *
 * ## The rest of a sample (issue #955)
 *
 * The oracle's sample carries `drawOrder`, `attachments`, `clips` and
 * `events` too, and since issue #955 the core poses each: the draw order
 * (`./draw_order.ts`), every drawn attachment's and clipping polygon's world
 * vertices through the sample's bones, in that order, with what the deform
 * and sequence timelines set on them (`./deform.ts`), and the events fired
 * since the sample before (`./events.ts`); each module's header states its
 * rules with the measurements. A path walks the curve the sample's deform
 * timelines left on its slot (`pathDeformed`). The attachments and clips are
 * absent where the bones or the slots are, and the attachments where a shown
 * region's rectangle is `null` or a timeline moves a record several skins
 * fill; the draw order where a slider keys it on a document whose bones are
 * absent.
