/**
 * Construct 5 of the core, first cut (issue #938, step 2e-i of issue #380):
 * the update order, and the two constraint kinds that move bones only by
 * what the bones and their target say — `ik` and `transform` — at the setup
 * pose and at a sample time, with their timelines. The second cut (issue
 * #938, step 2e-ii) adds `path`, whose record, walk and solver are
 * `./constraints_path.ts`'s; the third cut (2e-iii) adds `physics` under
 * `Physics.none` (`./constraints_physics.ts`: it applies nothing) and
 * `slider` (`./constraints_slider.ts`); the fourth (issue #956, 2e-iv)
 * steps physics when `applyConstraints` is given a step context — the
 * constraint then moves its bone in world space and the bones below it are
 * posed again, as after a world-space transform. Each is one more step of the update
 * loop below, so every constraint kind is posed; what the core still cannot
 * pose exactly leaves the bones out by name (`constraintsAbsentWhy`).
 *
 * Every rule below was measured by posing hand-written skeletons through
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts dump` (spine-core 4.3.13, `--skin all`,
 * `--physics none`) and comparing the core's rows at tolerance 0, most of them
 * with "amplifier" bones — a child a million units out along each axis of the
 * bone under test — so that a difference of 1e-12 in a matrix reads as one
 * grid step (the `CC` controls hold the populations at ten thousand units:
 * at a million a skewed chain's amplifier reached 1.7e9, where a double no
 * longer resolves the grid). Nothing here was written from the runtime's
 * source. The public
 * documentation fixes the order the constraints run in (the editor's list,
 * top first) and the shape of each solver; every numeric choice beyond that —
 * which frame, which wrap, which constant — is the measurement stated next to
 * it. The core suite's `CC` controls hold the hand-written probes, and
 * `tools/core_gate.ts` holds the corpus.
 *
 * ## The update order
 *
 * **Constraints run in the document's order** — the model lists them as the
 * rig declares them and the Spine file carries that order, which is the
 * runtime's constraint list (the oracle's `constraints` roster). After each
 * one, every bone below a bone it changed is posed again from its local
 * values under its parent's new world transform, so a later constraint reads
 * the bones as the earlier ones left them. Measured: 500 random nine-bone
 * rigs, each with two to six ik and transform constraints in random order,
 * random targets and sources, reflecting, sheared, non-normal and softened —
 * every one IDENTICAL at tolerance 0 (`CC05`). Swapping two constraints that
 * touch one chain moves the pose (`CC10`).
 *
 * - A constraint whose mix for a property is 0 does not touch that property,
 *   and one that touches nothing leaves the bone and everything under it
 *   exactly as they were — not re-posed from its local values. A transform
 *   constraint driving `y` alone whose `mixY` is absent (the pose's initial
 *   0) re-posed its bone's children from lossy local values in the first
 *   reading and was 4e-6 off; skipping it made the probe exact.
 * - **A bone a transform constraint moved in world space keeps that world
 *   transform**, and its local values are re-derived from it at once
 *   (`localFromWorld`, below), so that when a later constraint moves one of
 *   its ancestors it follows from those. Measured: a transform setting a
 *   child's world rotation, then an ik turning its parent by 90°, turned the
 *   child with the parent (the child's world rotation 180°); in the other
 *   order, 90°.
 * - **A slider poses again every bone its animation keys**, a timeline
 *   before its first key included (issue #989, `./constraints_slider.ts`,
 *   *Where it stands*): on a bone a transform moved in world space that
 *   rebuilds the world from the read-back local values, which the runtime
 *   does and keeping the world did not (`CZ01`).
 * - A constraint with `skin: true` is applied exactly when an APPLIED skin's
 *   list for its kind names it (`listedBySkin`, set per skin view by
 *   `underSkin` in `./index.ts`): under `--skin all` any skin's, under
 *   `--skin <name>` that skin's alone — the default skin's list does not
 *   count there. Measured for all five kinds (issue #932, which carries card
 *   #961's fix): a skin-required ik, transform, path, physics and slider
 *   constraint on a probe where applying it moves a bone, dumped under
 *   `--skin all`, `default` and `s1` against the same constraint at mix 0 —
 *   named by no list: inert under all three; named by `s1`'s list: applied
 *   under `all` and `s1`, inert under `default`; named by the default skin's
 *   list: applied under `all` and `default`, inert under `s1` — the same
 *   nine readings for every kind, 45 in all (the core suite's `CN02`). A name filed under another kind's list
 *   is refused by the runtime's loader (`Couldn't find IK constraint k for
 *   skin s1.`), and by `readModel`. The rule this replaced — `skin: true`
 *   never applied (2e-i) — was measured only on unlisted constraints; issue
 *   #956 corrected it for physics first. An ik whose target is inactive is
 *   not applied (measured on an ik with its target skin-required and named by
 *   no skin: the bone did not turn), nor a transform whose source is; an ik
 *   and a transform are applied to every bone they name, inactive ones
 *   included (*Unposed bones and collapsed frames*, below); a path constraint is applied exactly when its
 *   slot's bone is active (`./constraints_path.ts`, *Which constraints run*).
 * - A path constraint moves its bones in world space, as a world-space
 *   transform does, and reads the bones as the earlier constraints left
 *   them — except its slot bone's world, which the offset's sign reads as
 *   the runtime last set it: its update order is built before it poses, and
 *   a weighted path does not ask for its slot bone (`slotBonePlan`,
 *   *Which slot bone* there). This is the one place the order the runtime
 *   builds is observable: ik and transform ask for every bone they read.
 *
 * ## Unposed bones and collapsed frames (issue #979)
 *
 * A bone the posed skin leaves unposed — inactive, or below an inactive bone
 * — holds the zero matrix, so a constraint over it works in a collapsed
 * frame. The grid compare never reads such a bone (the oracle's
 * ill-conditioned rule, and a document spells `-0` as `0`), so every rule here
 * was measured through `tools/pose_oracle.ts unposed`, which compares those
 * rows by `Object.is`, and on posed "reader" bones that carry a bone's local
 * values through a local transform constraint. The rules, planted back one at
 * a time by the core suite's `CC13` and `CC14` (`SolverRules`):
 *
 * - **An ik frame of determinant at most 0.00001 is collapsed** — exactly
 *   0.00001 collapses, the next double above does not, on a posed parent
 *   (`CC14`). A one-bone ik then reads the target at the frame's origin (the
 *   offset `(0, 0)`, so `atan2` is 0): the bone turns to 0 less its `shearX`,
 *   plus 180 when it reflects, and `compress` scales it by `mix` toward 0.
 *   A two-bone ik reads its grandparent's inverse as zero, so the target and
 *   the child's origin are both the grandparent frame's origin. Before this
 *   the core divided by the determinant and wrote NaN into every field.
 * - **A one-bone ik under a `noRotationOrReflection` parent floors the
 *   parent x axis's squared length at 0.00001** when it builds the conformal
 *   frame (`k = |det| / max(0.00001, a² + c²)`): solving for the floor on
 *   five parents whose x axes are under it read 1.0000000166e-5 on each, and
 *   with 0.00001 written 432 of 432 probes over three modes, eight parent x
 *   scales, three y scales, three rotations and with or without
 *   `compress`/`stretch` read exact, where no floor read 33 off. `./world.ts`'s frame for the same mode has no floor.
 * - **`localFromWorld` under a collapsed parent** reads x and y as the
 *   division leaves them (NaN or infinite), `scaleX` 0, `shearY` 0, `scaleY`
 *   the y column's length (NaN) and `rotation` 0: a local x column that is not
 *   above 0.0001 — NaN included — is collapsed, and a y column no longer than
 *   0.00001 reads `rotation` 0 when the x column is collapsed too, and
 *   `shearY` 0 when it is not (measured by bisection: 1e-5 reads 0, the next
 *   double above reads the column's angle).
 * - **A world-space `rotate` source negates the constraint's `rotation`
 *   unless its determinant is above 0**: a source of determinant 0 negates it.
 * - **An inactive bone is not posed again** when a constraint moves a bone
 *   above it — it keeps its zeros, or what a constraint wrote into them — and
 *   the bones below it are posed again only when a constraint moved it
 *   itself (a path on an inactive bone moves the bones below it; a transform
 *   on its parent does not).
 * - **A transform constraint is applied when its source is active, to every
 *   bone it names**: one inactive bone among them did not stop it moving a
 *   posed one (the core skipped the whole constraint), and it wrote the
 *   source's position into the inactive one.
 *
 * Under these, transform (six flag sets, five modes), path, physics (under
 * `none` and the step) and one- and two-bone ik over unposed bones, and iks
 * aimed at them, read every bone row equal to spine-core's, the sign of every
 * zero included (`CC13`).
 *
 * ⚠️ **What the runtime writes into an INACTIVE constrained bone depends on
 * the pass before.** An ik naming an inactive bone is applied by the runtime
 * reading that bone's ancestors before it brings them up to date in the pass
 * — the previous pass's worlds, or zeros on a fresh skeleton — and a
 * transform or path writing into an inactive bone starts from the world the
 * previous pass left in it (the runtime does not reset it). Measured by
 * posing one skeleton sample after sample, as the oracle's dump does, against
 * a fresh skeleton per sample: an ik on `arm, hand` with `arm` inactive, a
 * transform onto an inactive bone at mix 0.5, additive or at mix 1, and a
 * path at mix 0.5 each read differently at 4 of 5 sample times (the mix-1
 * transform at 1 of 5, by 2.4e-17 in a `worldX` of 5.8e-7). The runtime
 * disagrees with itself there, so there is no rule of the format to hold, and
 * the core poses as a function of the model, the skin and the time: it reads
 * this class as a fresh skeleton does, which is the runtime's own setup pose.
 * A transform or path writes into an inactive bone from zeros; an ik naming
 * an inactive bone reads the frame above its first bone as zeros unless the
 * pass has brought that bone up to date before the ik (`frameUpdatedBefore`,
 * the order `slotBonePlan` walks), and as posed otherwise. Held against the
 * fresh reading on every row, and against the sequential one wherever the
 * two agree (`CC13`; `pose_oracle unposed` classes the rest HISTORY by
 * measurement). An ik on `arm, hand` with its target under `arm`'s parent, or
 * after a transform on that parent, read no history at all.
 *
 * The render never reads an unposed bone (the seam's zero snapshot), so the
 * history reaches a picture only through a POSED bone that a constraint moves
 * while reading a bone the history reached — and that pose is refused by
 * name (`unposedLeakWhy`), which the render meets by falling back to
 * spine-core. The taint is by bone and by what the reader reads, its world
 * or its local values: measured on 48 writer-and-reader probes (`CC15`),
 * every one whose posed rows spine-core's two readings disagree on (14) is
 * refused, and 8 are refused where the reader reads a part of the bone the
 * history does not move — a refusal costs a named fallback, a miss a picture
 * that depends on which frame played before.
 *
 * ## Reading local values back from a world transform (`localFromWorld`)
 *
 * The runtime's re-derived values were read directly: a second transform
 * constraint with `localSource` reading the bone's `rotate`, `x`, `y`,
 * `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `shearY` onto an unrelated bone's `x` at scale 10000
 * gave each to 1e-10, and they agree with these rules on every probe:
 *
 * - `normal`: the local matrix is the parent's inverse (1 over its
 *   determinant, multiplied in) times the world matrix, and the local
 *   position the same inverse applied to the world origin's offset. Then
 *   `scaleX` is the x column's length and `shearX` is 0; ⚠️ **a local x
 *   column shorter than 0.0001 is read as `scaleX` 0**, `shearY` 0, `scaleY`
 *   the y column's length and `rotation` the y column's angle less 90 —
 *   measured on a column collapsed to 1.8e-6 by two `scaleX` properties, where
 *   the runtime read `rotation` −248.958 (the unwrapped y angle less 90) and
 *   `scaleX` 0. Otherwise `rotation` is the x column's angle, `scaleY` the y
 *   column's length — NEGATIVE when the determinant is — and `shearY` the y
 *   column's angle less `rotation + 90`, or less `rotation − 90` when the
 *   determinant is negative, brought once into (−180, 180]. The negative
 *   `scaleY` and the right angle taken off the other way are what reproduce
 *   the runtime's ±2.66e-6° residual on a reflected bone: 138 of 400
 *   reflected and sheared probes missed with a positive `scaleY`; turning the
 *   y angle by 180 first agrees to 1e-10 and not to the bit (below).
 * - `onlyTranslation`: the world matrix is the local matrix.
 * - `noRotationOrReflection`: the local matrix is taken against the parent's
 *   conformal matrix (the frame `./world.ts` builds for that mode), and the
 *   parent's x-axis angle is added to the rotation.
 * - `noScale`, `noScaleOrReflection`: `rotation` is the angle of the parent's
 *   inverse applied to the world x column; the frame the forward pose builds
 *   from that rotation (`noScaleDirection` in `./world.ts`) is formed, both
 *   world columns are read in it (flipped when the parent reflects, for
 *   `noScale`), and that local matrix is decomposed with its x column's
 *   angle — a residual of rounding — kept as `shearX`, and `shearY` measured
 *   from 0, as the forward frame `frame(0, shearX, shearY, …)` reads them.
 *
 * Each of the five held on 300 probes at the million-unit amplifier: a world
 * edit on the bone, then a translation-only edit on its parent that makes the
 * bone re-posed from its re-derived values (`CC06`).
 *
 * ## To the bit (issue #966)
 *
 * Held against `pose_oracle.ts dump --raw` at tolerance 0 (the core suite's
 * `CR01`, the `CC` populations and seeds; the corpus through `core_gate
 * --raw`), these orders are the runtime's where the grid could not tell:
 *
 * - a one-bone ik accumulates the change from the bone's own angles first,
 *   `−shearX − rotation + turn + atan2·DEG` (the target's direction first
 *   read 53 of 600 random iks off);
 * - a two-bone ik takes the child's offset angle off in radians before
 *   turning the change into degrees, `(a1 − offset)·DEG` (`a1·DEG −
 *   offset·DEG` read 44 bone findings on `spineboy-pro` against 4);
 * - an ik timeline's keyed mix and softness reach the pose through the
 *   setup blend, `setup + (value − setup)·1` (the value as keyed read a
 *   Bézier-eased mix 2 ulp off on `spineboy-pro`'s jump);
 * - a world-space rotate turns the change in radians, wrapped at the
 *   runtime's pi (the degree form read 113 bone findings on `spineboy-pro`
 *   against 44);
 * - `localFromWorld` forms the inverse's entries before applying them, and
 *   reads the shear as `yAngle − (rotation + 90)`;
 * - and, in the second cut (the band `CW` controls; each rule planted back to
 *   the reading before it by a `SolverRules` flag), the three read-back forms
 *   above — a reflected bone's shear as the y angle less `rotation − 90`
 *   (`CW01`); `noRotationOrReflection`'s columns as `(pa·wa + pc·wc)·(1/(pa² +
 *   pc²))` and `(pa·wc − pc·wa)·(1/|det|)` (`CW02`); the `noScale` modes read
 *   in the frame of the rotation read first, the residual kept as `shearX`
 *   (`CW03`) — which bring the read-back population from 164 to 400 of 400,
 *   the update-order population from 389 to 400 and the stepped physics
 *   population (`CR07`) from 140 to 150 of 150; an additive world-space
 *   `shearY` as `(v + 90)·RAD − 90·RAD` (`CW04`: the transform population
 *   from 865 to 900 of 900); a transform timeline's mixes through the setup
 *   blend (`CW05`); and the two-bone ik over a parent whose scale is 0, below;
 * - and a path timeline's position, spacing and mixes through the setup blend
 *   too (issue #984, `CY01`; *The timelines*, below), and a slider
 *   timeline's `time` and `mix` (issue #991, `CZ03`).
 *
 * The local values were read to the bit rather than through the re-posed
 * world: a reader bone's `x` driven by a local transform from the bone's
 * `rotate`, `x`, `y`, `scaleX`, `scaleY` or `shearY` at scale 1 under the
 * root is the value itself in the raw dump. That separated a wrong local
 * value from a right one the forward pose reads differently — the `noScale`
 * modes' local values read bit-exact before their world did, which is how
 * the kept `shearX` was found.
 *
 * ## ik — one bone
 *
 * The bone turns so its x axis points at the target. With `v` the target in
 * the bone's parent frame:
 *
 * - `normal`, `noScale`, `noScaleOrReflection`: the parent's world matrix,
 *   inverted by dividing by its determinant, applied to the target's offset
 *   from the PARENT's world origin, less the bone's local `x`, `y`.
 *   `onlyTranslation`: the target's offset from the bone's own world origin,
 *   as it is. `noRotationOrReflection`: as `normal`, with the parent's
 *   conformal matrix (x axis kept, y axis at 90° with length |det| / |x|) for
 *   its matrix, and the parent's x-axis angle added to the angle. Each other
 *   reading of that mode missed 14 to 200 of 300 probes; the offset from the
 *   bone's own origin, for `normal`, is the same number up to rounding and
 *   was exact on every random probe — ⚠️ but a target AT the bone's origin
 *   has only rounding noise for a direction, and the runtime turned such a
 *   bone to 56.56° where that reading read 30° (0.3345 off in `b`); the
 *   parent-origin reading reproduces the noise exactly (`CC04`).
 * - The rotation it needs is `atan2(v)` less `shearX` less the current
 *   rotation, plus 180 when `scaleX` is negative, brought once into
 *   (−180, 180], times `mix`, added to the rotation.
 * - `compress` / `stretch`: with `len` the bone's `length` times `scaleX` and
 *   `d` the length of `v` — of the world offset for the two `noScale` modes —
 *   when `len` is above 0.00001 (issue #966, by bisection: 0.00001 exactly is
 *   left alone and the double above is scaled; 0.0001, the reading before,
 *   left every bone between the two unscaled) and the target is nearer (`compress`) or
 *   farther (`stretch`), `scaleX` is multiplied by `(d / len − 1) · mix + 1`.
 *   With `scaleY` `uniform` `scaleY` is multiplied by the same `s`; with
 *   `volume` it is divided by `s`, except below 0.7 where it is divided by
 *   `0.25 + s · 0.642857`. That constant is measured: a bone of `scaleY`
 *   100000 compressed to seven lengths read `(1/scaleY − 0.25) / s` =
 *   0.642857000 to nine places on every one, and the break is between 0.6999
 *   and 0.7001.
 * - `mix` 0 leaves the bone alone.
 *
 * Measured: 1,000 random probes each over rotated, scaled, reflecting and
 * sheared parents and bones, all five inherit modes, `compress`, `stretch`,
 * the three `scaleY` modes and random `mix`, all exact (`CC02`).
 *
 * ## ik — two bones
 *
 * The public documentation: the second bone must be a child of the first;
 * the child's tip reaches the target; `bendPositive` picks the side;
 * `softness` slows the chain as it straightens; `stretch` scales it to reach.
 * Measured, in the parent's parent frame (the "grandparent", its world
 * matrix inverted by multiplying by 1 over its determinant):
 *
 * - **Either bone not `normal`: the constraint does nothing** (all four
 *   other modes on each bone, 200 probes each).
 * - The parent keeps its shear. ⚠️ The public page says the parent's local
 *   shear is set to 0; spine-core 4.3.13 keeps it (100 sheared probes: 100
 *   off with the shear zeroed, 0 kept).
 * - **Uniform** when the parent's |scaleX| and |scaleY| differ by at most
 *   0.00001 — measured between 9.9e-6 (uniform) and 1.01e-5 (not), at scales
 *   0.5, 1 and 2. The public page's "nonuniform" was read as 0.0001 at first,
 *   and a world-edited parent at 1.00005 went 2,261,052 units off at the
 *   amplifier.
 * - The child's local `y` is set to 0 when the scale is not uniform or
 *   `stretch` is on; otherwise it is kept, and it offsets the angles by
 *   `atan2(y, x)` of the child's local position — unscaled.
 * - `l1` is the distance, in the grandparent frame, from the parent's local
 *   origin to the child's world origin (that is, the parent's world matrix
 *   applied to the child's local `x`, `y`); `l2` is the child's `length`
 *   times |its scaleX|; the target is read in the same frame.
 * - **softness**: `s` = `softness` · |parent scaleX| · (|child scaleX| + 1) ·
 *   0.5; with `d` the target's distance and `sd = d − l1 − l2·|scaleX| + s`,
 *   when `sd > 0` the target is drawn in toward the parent by
 *   `(sd − s·(1 − q²)) / d` of itself, `q = min(1, sd / 2s) − 1`: the chain
 *   reaches `d − sd²/4s` until `sd` is `2s`, and full length after. Measured
 *   on a straight chain at eleven distances and two softnesses, then at the
 *   amplifier: the fully softened chain is ill-conditioned (its bend is the
 *   arc-cosine of 1 − a few ulp), and only this arithmetic, with the
 *   subtraction in this order and the square root (not `hypot`) for `l1`,
 *   read it exactly — 132, 102, 59 and 10 of 1,000 missed on the way.
 * - **Uniform**: the law of cosines, `cos = (d² − l1² − l2²) / (2·l1·l2)`
 *   with `l2` scaled by |scaleX|; below −1 the bend is π·bend, above 1 it is
 *   0 and `stretch` multiplies the parent's `scaleX` (and `scaleY` for
 *   `uniform`, divides it for `volume`) by `(d/(l1+l2) − 1)·mix + 1`. The
 *   parent's angle is one `atan2` of the target turned back by the bend's
 *   offset — the difference of two `atan2`s is off by 2π about 1 time in 30,
 *   and 2π in the runtime's degrees is not 2π.
 * - **Not uniform**: the child's tip at `(X, Y)` in the parent's scaled frame
 *   solves `(b² − a²)X² − 2b²·l1·X + b²·l1² + a²·d² − a²b² = 0`
 *   (`a`, `b` = `l2` times |scaleX|, |scaleY|), solved the numerically stable
 *   way and taking the root of smaller magnitude; when it has none, the
 *   nearest reachable pose of the three candidates — folded, straight and the
 *   ellipse's vertex — on the side of the midpoint of their squared reaches
 *   the target is. The folded bend is π in the runtime's own π (3.1415927);
 *   the parent's angle is here the DIFFERENCE of two `atan2`s.
 * - The parent's rotation is the angle less the offset, plus 180 when its
 *   `scaleX` is negative, and the child's is `(bend + offset)·deg − shearX`,
 *   times the product of the parent's scale signs, plus 180 when the child's
 *   `scaleX` is negative. Each change is brought once into (−180, 180] —
 *   **−180 goes to 180**: a folded chain under a reflecting parent read the
 *   same child angle for both bends, measured at `mix` 0.5 — and multiplied
 *   by `mix`.
 *
 * Measured: 2,000 random probes per combination — grandparents rotated,
 * scaled, reflecting and sheared; parents uniform, reflecting and not
 * uniform; children offset in `y`, scaled, reflecting and sheared; `stretch`,
 * `softness`, the `scaleY` modes, both bends, random `mix` — exact at the
 * amplifier (`CC03`). Degenerate cases (`CC04`): the child at the parent's
 * origin, the target at the parent's origin, the chain exactly straight,
 * exactly folded, the softness onset and its end, a child of length 0 — all
 * exact. The runtime throws on an ik whose (first) bone is the root, so the
 * reader refuses it. A collapsed grandparent (determinant 0) is left to the
 * oracle's ill-conditioned rule, which excludes the bone and everything below
 * it — the one case where the core's value is not the runtime's.
 *
 * **A parent whose scale is 0** (issue #966, reducing #959's third class, "a
 * transform collapsing a bone's scale, with an ik below it", to a two-bone ik
 * with no transform at all; `CW06`–`CW08`, compared by `Object.is` on every
 * bone, the ones compare's ill-conditioned rule leaves out included):
 *
 * - a scale of 0 counts as POSITIVE in the product of the parent's scale
 *   signs that turns the child's offset and angle — `Math.sign` read it as 0
 *   and read 59 of 300 iks over a parent of `scaleY` 0 exact;
 * - **a child whose origin is nearer the parent's than 0.00001** in the
 *   grandparent frame (`l1`) makes the constraint a one-bone ik on the parent
 *   — stretched as the constraint says, never compressed, its `scaleY` mode
 *   read as none — with the child posed at rotation 0 and the local `y` the
 *   solver set. A parent `scaleX` of 0 puts every child there (2 of 300
 *   exact before). By bisection on the parent's x scale at three child
 *   offsets and three rotations the edge is the distance, not the scale:
 *   0.00001 exactly solves and the double below folds (`CW07`). The child at
 *   the parent's origin (`CC04`) is the same fold.
 *
 * ## transform

 * 4.3's form: `properties` maps each source property (`rotate`, `x`, `y`,
 * `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `shearY`) with its `offset` to one or more target
 * properties, each with `offset`, `scale` and `max`. For each constrained
 * bone, each source property in the document's order, each target property:
 *
 * - **The source's value.** World (`localSource` false): `rotate` is the x
 *   column's angle, plus the constraint's `rotation` — negated when the source
 *   reflects — and then brought into [0, 360) by adding 360 once when below 0
 *   (a scale of 0.5 read 95 for a source at −170); `x`, `y` are the source's
 *   world transform applied to the constraint's `x`, `y`; `scaleX`, `scaleY`
 *   the column lengths plus the constraint's offsets; `shearY` the angle
 *   between the columns less 90, plus `shearY`. Local: the source's local
 *   value (as constraints so far left it) plus the offset, unwrapped.
 * - Less the source property's `offset`, times the target property's `scale`
 *   (absent 1), plus its `offset` (absent 0); with `clamp`, held between its
 *   `offset` and its `max` whichever is larger — `max` absent reads 1 (a
 *   clamped 30 read 1).
 * - **The mix** of the target property: `mixRotate`, `mixX`, `mixScaleX`,
 *   `mixShearY` absent read 1 for a driven property; `mixY` absent reads the
 *   resolved `mixX` when `x` is driven and 0 when it is not, `mixScaleY` the
 *   same over `scaleX` (the parser's reading, `src/keyorder.ts`'s note on the
 *   transform constraint, measured again here). A mix of 0 applies nothing.
 * - **World** (`localTarget` false): `rotate` turns both columns by the
 *   change to the value (or by the value, `additive`) brought once into
 *   (−180, 180] and times the mix; `x`, `y` move the world origin; `scaleX`,
 *   `scaleY` scale a column to the value (or by it, additive: `1 + (v−1)·mix`);
 *   `shearY` turns the y column to `v + 90` degrees from the x column, the
 *   change brought once into (−π, π] with the RUNTIME's π (78 of 300 missed
 *   with Math.PI), keeping its length — additive, it turns the y column by
 *   `((v + 90)·RAD − 90·RAD)·mix`, unwrapped (issue #966, `CW04`: `v·RAD`
 *   agrees on the grid and read 35 of 132 probes last-bit off). **Local**: the local field moves
 *   toward the value by the mix (additive: adds `v·mix`, or scales by
 *   `1 + (v−1)·mix`).
 *
 * Measured: 800 probes per property in world mode over reflecting, sheared,
 * offset, scaled and clamped sources and targets; 300 per property and mode
 * pair for local, additive and both; 1,000 with random cross-mappings (a
 * property to several, several to one); the six identity mappings in both
 * key orders — all exact, amplified (`CC07`). Every one on bones of all five
 * inherit modes.
 *
 * ## The timelines
 *
 * An `ik` timeline keys `mix` and `softness` (two curve channels) and
 * `bendPositive`, `compress`, `stretch` (stepped: the flags of the last key
 * at or before `t`); a `transform` timeline keys the six mixes (six
 * channels). The key search and the curves are construct 4's
 * (`keyIndexAt`, `channelAt` in `./animation.ts`), key times and values
 * float32, a Bézier from the stated numbers. Before the first key the
 * constraint's own values; a key omitting a field reads the parser's value
 * for it — `mix` 1, `softness` 0, `bendPositive` true, `compress` and
 * `stretch` false; a transform key's mixes 1, `mixY` the key's `mixX`
 * (`src/keyorder.ts`, `PARSER_DEFAULTS`). `CC08` holds each. The keyed values
 * reach the pose through the setup blend at alpha 1, `setup + (value −
 * setup)·1`, for both kinds (issue #966: the ik's mix on the corpus, the
 * transform's six mixes on `CW05`'s probe, where the value as keyed read 0
 * of 60 exact).
 *
 * A `path` timeline's values — `position`, `spacing` and the three mixes
 * (`./constraints_path.ts`, *The record and its timelines*) — reach the pose
 * through the same setup blend (issue #984). The reading before was the
 * value as keyed; the corpus could not tell them apart, since its one row
 * keying a path timeline keys `position` over a setup position of 0, where
 * `0 + (value − 0)·1` is the value to the bit. Measured on `CY01`'s probes —
 * 60 per timeline, keyed by Bézier segments over setup values that include 0
 * and negatives, in every position, spacing and rotate mode, one to three
 * bones, under `--raw` at 40 irrational samples, tolerance 0 — the value as
 * keyed read position 33, spacing 40 and mix 1 of 60 bit-exact (0 of 60 with
 * all three keyed), the blend 60 of 60 on each; each mix channel alone
 * planted back to the value as keyed turns the mix population red.
 *
 * A `slider` timeline's `time` and `mix` go through the same setup blend
 * (issue #991, `CZ03`; `./constraints_slider.ts`, *Its timelines*).
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * As the rest of the core: nothing from the Spine runtime package, nothing
 * from `src/transform.ts`, no clock, no randomness, no I/O.
