/**
 * Construct 4 of the core, its remainder (issue #955, step 2f of issue #380):
 * the events an animation's event timeline fires between two samples — the
 * oracle's per-sample `events` block, `[name, time, int, float, string]`.
 *
 * Every rule below was measured by posing hand-written skeletons through
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts dump` (spine-core 4.3.13) and reading the block back;
 * nothing here was written from the runtime's source. The core suite's `CD`
 * controls hold the same skeletons against the core.
 *
 * - **A sample lists the keys whose time is in `(previous sample's t, t]`**,
 *   the first sample's interval opening at −1: an event keyed at 0.25 fired
 *   at the sample at 0.25 and not at the one after; one keyed at 0 fired at
 *   the first sample; on an animation of duration 0 every sample sits at 0,
 *   and the keys at 0 fired at the first sample alone.
 * - **Key times are float32**: an event keyed at 0.1 (float32
 *   0.10000000149) did not fire at a sample at 0.1 but at the next.
 * - **In key order**: two events keyed at one time fired in the order the
 *   keys are listed.
 * - **The row's time is the key's (float32), and each of `int`, `float`,
 *   `string` is the key's where it states one, else the event
 *   definition's, else the parser's `0`, `0`, `""`** — an event declared with
 *   no string read `""`, not `null` (so `tools/pose_oracle.ts`' header, which
 *   said `null`, was wrong about the runtime and says so now). `volume` and
 *   `balance` are the audio's, and the block does not carry them.
 * - **`float` is the double the document states**, the definition's and the
 *   key's alike: `0.1000065`, which rounds to `0.100007` as a double and to
 *   `0.100006` through `Math.fround`, read `0.100007` from each.
 * - A slider fires no event into the block: the oracle lists the events of
 *   the sample's own animation.
