/**
 * The core's raw entry (issue #966, step 3b of issue #380): one pose, or one
 * animation walked at the caller's own steps, returned as the doubles the
 * core computed — no grid — with everything a renderer or a deform measurer
 * reads past the oracle's rows: each bone's world rotation and scale
 * readings, each drawn attachment's local UVs, triangles, hull, sequence
 * frame and colour, the clip polygons, the triangles drawn under a clip, and
 * the events fired.
 *
 * The oracle's document (`tools/pose_oracle.ts`) samples an animation on a
 * phase grid, re-applying it from the setup pose at every sample; the two
 * consumers step instead. `src/render.ts` resets a track at 0 and then takes
 * exactly one step of `1/fps` per frame; `src/deformmeasure.ts` resets and
 * takes one step of `time`. So the entry takes a list of steps rather than a
 * list of times, and this header states what one step is, as measured.
 *
 * ## One step — the walk, measured
 *
 * Measured against spine-core 4.3.13 running `src/render.ts`'s recipe
 * (`AnimationState` with one non-looping track: frame 0 `apply`,
 * `Skeleton.update(0)`, `updateWorldTransform(Physics.reset)`; every later
 * frame `AnimationState.update(dt)`, `apply`, `Skeleton.update(dt)`,
 * `updateWorldTransform(Physics.update)`), read off `TrackEntry.trackTime`,
 * `TrackEntry.getAnimationTime()` and every bone's `appliedPose` in full
 * doubles (the PR of issue #966 carries the table):
 *
 * - **The track time is the running sum of the steps**, `T += dt` in double,
 *   not `i·dt`, and the animation is applied at the sum. Over every
 *   animation of the nineteen tree rows `TrackEntry.trackTime` equalled the
 *   running sum on 2,612 of 2,612 frames at 12 fps (12,850 of 12,850 at 60,
 *   5,173 of 5,173 at 24) and `i·dt` on only 662 (1,168; 810): at 12 fps
 *   frame 6 reads `0.49999999999999994`, not `0.5`, and frame 10
 *   `0.8333333333333334`, not `0.8333333333333333`. `src/render.ts` files a
 *   frame under `i·dt`, which is its label and not the time posed.
 * - **A non-looping track holds at its duration**: the animation time is
 *   `min(T, duration)`, where `duration` is the runtime's (the last key of
 *   every timeline, as float32 — `CoreAnimationTimelines.duration`). With
 *   `round(duration·fps)` frames the last one overshoots on 20 animation
 *   frames of the 2,612 at 12 fps (19 at 60, 25 at 24), and
 *   `getAnimationTime()` read the duration on every one of them.
 * - **The physics clock moves by the step itself**, `time += dt` (the
 *   skeleton's `update`), and a physics constraint integrates the time it
 *   moved (`./constraints_physics.ts`). Pose 0 is the reset, every physics
 *   state reset there (where, below).
 * - **Events fire over `(previous animation time, animation time]`**, the
 *   first step's interval opening at −1 — so held past the duration, a step
 *   fires nothing. Measured against `AnimationState`'s event listener on
 *   every frame above.
 * - **Where the reset is taken is the caller's** (`RawReset`): render's
 *   frame 0 applies the animation at 0 and resets there (`animation`);
 *   deformmeasure's `poseAt` resets at the setup pose and then applies the
 *   animation in its one step (`setup`). On a physics rig the two differ by
 *   whole units, not bits: of the 162 one-jump poses (three per animation),
 *   12 read off under `animation` — six on `7-anticipation`'s physics rig (a
 *   cape bone 1.7° off at 0.617 s) and six on `gallery/look`'s — and none
 *   under `setup`.
 *
 * Every step poses the animation from the setup pose at its animation time
 * (the setup blend at alpha 1), as the oracle's stepped dump does, applied
 * from the animation time of the step before (−1 before the first): a
 * physics `reset` key fires on the step that crosses it, once. Until issue
 * #960 this walk fired such a key at every step from it on (the oracle's
 * reading then), and against the recipe above a probe with a key at 0.5
 * read 32 of 61 frames bit-exact at 60 fps, the rest off by up to 53 units;
 * with the key crossed once, 61 of 61 at 60 fps and 13 of 13 at 12. None of
 * the nineteen tree rows keys a `reset`, which is why the raw gate never
 * saw it. The one difference from `--physics step` is where the steps fall,
 * which is the caller's.
 *
 * ## What a pose carries
 *
 * - `bones` — the world matrix and origin, and the four readings the
 *   runtime's getters give: `rotationX = atan2(c, a)·DEG`, `rotationY =
 *   atan2(d, b)·DEG`, `scaleX = √(a² + c²)`, `scaleY = √(b² + d²)`, with
 *   `DEG = 180 / π` at the runtime's π (`RUNTIME_DEG` in `./world.ts`) —
 *   measured bit-exact against `BonePose.getWorldRotationX/Y` and
 *   `getWorldScaleX/Y` on every bone of 2,793 poses of the nineteen tree
 *   rows (the setup, every 12 fps frame, three jumps per animation).
 * - `slots` — the oracle's slot row as doubles (`posedSlots`).
 * - `drawn` — every region and mesh a slot shows, in draw order: its world
 *   vertices (the oracle's `attachments` row as doubles), its LOCAL UVs as the
 *   runtime holds them (a region's unit corners `0 1, 0 0, 1 0, 1 1` in the
 *   corner order; a mesh's `uvs` — a linked mesh's source's — as the
 *   document spells them: `MeshAttachment.regionUVs` read the doubles, not
 *   their float32, on every mesh of the nineteen rows — `6-arcs`'
 *   `2.554152e-7` where `Math.fround` gives `2.5541518766658555e-7`), its
 *   triangles (a region's `0 1 2 2
 *   3 0`), its hull (a mesh's; `null` for a region), its sequence frame (the
 *   frame a sequence timeline set, else the series' setup frame, else 0 —
 *   the runtime gives every region and mesh a series, one frame long when
 *   the record states none, and `Sequence.resolveIndex` read 0 on every such
 *   attachment of the nineteen rows) and its own colour (the record's `color`, white
 *   unstated) — so the caller forms the tint, slot colour times attachment
 *   colour, itself. Where a region sits on a page is not the model's
 *   (`ModelAtlasRect`'s 🔸); the page UVs are issue #967's.
 * - `clips`, `clipped` — the oracle's rows as doubles; `clipped` is what the
 *   core DRAWS, which is the oracle's block wherever the core poses it and,
 *   under a clip that is not strictly convex or is inverse (a block the core
 *   leaves out), the core's own convex decomposition (`clipThrough` in
 *   `./clipping.ts`, issue #964), held to spine-core by the render's pixels.
 * - `events` — the oracle's event rows as doubles.
 *
 * 🔁 **A second walk shares this one** (issue #1025, cut 4c-5a): A10's
 * LOOPING walk, which keeps a non-finite value rather than refusing it, is
 * `./walk.ts`; both are `walkIn` below in a `WalkMode`, and every difference
 * is a branch on the mode — so this entry's walk is the one it was, and the
 * raw gate's lines did not move.
 *
 * ⛔ **Nothing is posed that the core would leave out.** Where the oracle's
 * core dump names a block absent — a constraint the core cannot pose
 * exactly, skins disagreeing over a placeholder under the merged view, a
 * region with no atlas rectangle — the raw entry refuses the whole call,
 * naming why (`CoreInputError`): a renderer handed a pose with a block
 * missing would draw a different picture in silence.

// --- #907 the setup-pose bounding box: begin ---
/**
 * The setup-pose bounding box (issue #907) — `setupBounds` below: the axis-aligned box around every
 * region and mesh a skeleton draws at its setup pose, as spine-core's
 * `Skeleton.getBounds(offset, size, temp)` returns it on a fresh skeleton —
 * no skin set, `updateWorldTransform(Physics.none)` — which is what the Spine
 * format says the header's `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` are.
 *
 * Every rule below was measured by running spine-core 4.3.13 through the
 * tree's own loader, not read off its source:
 *
 * - **The view is "no skin set"** (`underNoSkin`, issue #1051): a skeleton
 *   `build` writes is loaded and bounded before anyone calls `setSkin`, so
 *   the slots resolve through the default skin alone and no skin's bones or
 *   constraint lists apply.
 * - **Constraints applied.** The box is of the pose `updateWorldTransform`
 *   leaves, every ik, transform, path and slider constraint applied in the
 *   document's order — the pose `poseSetup` computes. The editor's own
 *   header is of that pose too: on `examples/spineboy/export/spineboy-pro.json`
 *   (seven ik and seven transform constraints) `getBounds` with the
 *   constraints applied is within 0.0035 of the header the editor wrote, and
 *   with them stripped it is 0.31 off in `y` and `height`.
 * - **Physics.none.** A physics constraint applies nothing at the setup pose
 *   (the oracle's setup reading). Under `Physics.reset` spine-core's box was
 *   the same, to the bit, on all nineteen tree rows (two declare a physics constraint).
 * - **What is counted.** A region's four corners and a mesh's (a linked
 *   mesh's) world vertices — the rows of the oracle's `setup.attachments`
 *   block, in full doubles. A clipping polygon, a bounding box, a path and a
 *   point are not counted (measured: each placed 5000 units out moved
 *   `getBounds` by nothing), and the box is not clipped: `getBounds` called
 *   without its optional clipper.
 * - **A slot on an inactive bone is not counted** — measured: a skin-required
 *   bone 1000 units out, which only a named skin activates, carrying a region
 *   left `getBounds` at the other region's 20 units with no skin set, and 1020
 *   with the bone not skin-required. A bone that is not skin-required under an
 *   inactive parent is active and unposed, and its slot is counted at the
 *   vertices that pose gives; the core poses the same vertices (the oracle's
 *   `setup.attachments`, held at tolerance 0), and a probe of that shape read
 *   the same box both ways.
 * - **The box.** `x`, `y` are the least `x` and `y` over every counted
 *   vertex and `width`, `height` the greatest less the least — the
 *   bottom-left corner in Spine's y-up world, not the top-left. In full
 *   doubles; `build` writes each on the model's 1e-6 grid at float32
 *   (`headerBoxNumber` in `src/compile.ts`, whose comment says why).
 * - **Nothing drawn is no box.** `getBounds` over no vertex returns an offset
 *   of `+Infinity` and a size of `-Infinity`, which is not a box; this
 *   returns `null` for it, and the emitter writes no box rather than a number
 *   nobody measured.
 *
 * Pure, like the rest of `src/core/`: it links nothing from the runtime, and
 * `tools/core_gate.ts` holds it to `getBounds` at tolerance 0 over the corpus
 * (its `BOUNDS` rows).
