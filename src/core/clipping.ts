/**
 * The core's sixth construct: clipping applied to the draw (issue #964, §5
 * item 6 of the design on issue #380) — the oracle's `clipped` block, the
 * triangles every region and mesh drawn while a clip is active hands to the
 * runtime's clipper, as the clipper returns them.
 *
 * ## How every rule below was fixed
 *
 * By running spine-core 4.3.13's `SkeletonClipping` — `clipStart`,
 * `clipEnd(slot)`, `clipEnd()`, `isClipping` and `clipTrianglesUnpacked`, the
 * calls `src/render.ts` makes, in the order it makes them — on hand-written
 * skeletons and on random triangles and polygons, and reading what it
 * returned: the return value, `clippedVerticesTyped`, `clippedUVsTyped`,
 * `clippedTrianglesTyped`. The runtime's source was not read. Each rule is a
 * reading that reproduced every case measured, next to the readings the
 * measurements rejected. The core suite's `CL` controls hold a hand-written
 * skeleton of every case against the runtime at tolerance 0.
 *
 * ## When a clip is active — the draw walk
 *
 * The walk is `src/render.ts`'s `piecesOf`: slots in the posed draw order; at
 * a clipping attachment, end the clip if this slot is its end, then start
 * this clip if its slot's bone is active and no clip is active; at every
 * other slot, clip what it draws while a clip is active, then end the clip
 * if this slot is its end. Measured on one hand-written skeleton per case:
 *
 * | case | read |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | a clip ending at a slot | that slot is clipped, the one after it is not |
 * | ending at a slot that shows nothing | ends there all the same |
 * | ending at a slot drawn BEFORE the clip, or at its own slot | never ends: every later slot is clipped |
 * | no end slot | every later slot is clipped |
 * | a second clip while the first is active | ignored: a region inside the second and outside the first read wholly cut |
 * | a second clip after the first ended | applies |
 * | a clip ending at the slot of the next clip | the next clip starts there |
 * | a clip on an inactive bone | starts nothing |
 * | a region on an inactive bone under a clip | clipped like any other |
 *
 * ## What one triangle becomes
 *
 * The clip polygon is the clipping attachment's world polygon (the `clips`
 * row, `./vertices.ts`), unrounded. When its signed area is positive (counter
 * clockwise, y up) its vertices are reversed, so it is walked clockwise, and
 * its edges are taken from vertex 0: `(v0, v1), (v1, v2), …, (vn-1, v0)`.
 * A point is inside an edge `(p, q)` when `(q.x − p.x)(y − p.y) − (q.y −
 * p.y)(x − p.x) < 0`, strictly.
 *
 * Each triangle `(a, b, c)` of the attachment, in its own order, is clipped
 * edge by edge (Sutherland–Hodgman): walking the current polygon's sides
 * `(s, e)` from `(v0, v1)` round to `(vk, v0)`, an inside `s` with an inside
 * `e` keeps `e`; inside to outside adds the intersection; outside to inside
 * adds the intersection and then `e`; outside to outside adds nothing. The
 * intersection is `s + t·(e − s)` with `t = ((q.x − p.x)(s.y − p.y) − (q.y −
 * p.y)(s.x − p.x)) / ((q.y − p.y)(e.x − s.x) − (q.x − p.x)(e.y − s.y))`, in
 * doubles. A triangle no side of which was outside any edge is returned as it
 * came, `a, b, c` — not the rotation the walk leaves it in. A result of fewer
 * than three points adds nothing; otherwise its points are appended and fanned
 * from the first: `(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 3), …` offset by the vertices already
 * written. The clipper stores vertices and UVs as float32: every number
 * written goes through `Math.fround`.
 *
 * A triangle no side of which was outside any edge keeps its corners' own
 * UVs (through `Math.fround`) rather than weighing them — the two agree on
 * the grid, and on three rows of `spineboy-pro`'s portal the weighed UV of a
 * corner at 0 read `2e-17` where the runtime holds 0 (issue #966, `dump
 * --raw`). Each point of a triangle that was cut has a UV barycentric over
 * the source triangle, from the unrounded
 * point: with `d = 1 / ((b.y − c.y)(a.x − c.x) + (c.x − b.x)(a.y − c.y))`,
 * `wa = ((b.y − c.y)(x − c.x) + (c.x − b.x)(y − c.y))·d`,
 * `wb = ((c.y − a.y)(x − c.x) + (a.x − c.x)(y − c.y))·d`, `wc = 1 − wa − wb`,
 * and `uv = ua·wa + ub·wb + uc·wc`, the corner UVs read through
 * `Math.fround`.
 *
 * The clipper returns `true` when any triangle had a point outside any edge,
 * else `false` — and `src/render.ts` then draws the attachment's own geometry.
 *
 * Measured on 2641 random cases, every polygon strictly convex, both
 * windings, one to three triangles of both windings each: 400 against
 * polygons of three to seven vertices, 600 whose intersections fall near the
 * origin, 1200 with corner UVs chosen so the weights' rounding shows, 300
 * cutting one edge once, and 141 random star polygons that came out convex —
 * the vertex list, the UVs, the triangle list and the return value exact on
 * 2641 of 2641. On the public corpus, `spineboy-pro`'s portal animation
 * (a three-vertex clip ending at a slot) reads IDENTICAL at tolerance 0 on
 * 4338 rows drawn under it (241 dense samples; 2653 left whole, 106 cut,
 * 1579 cut away). Rejected readings, each with what it read:
 *
 * | reading | read |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | the polygon's own winding, edges from vertex 0 | triangle lists 219 of 400; vertices 36 |
 * | the polygon made counter-clockwise, inside on the left | triangle lists 400; vertices in order 130 of 400 |
 * | a triangle wholly inside returned as the walk leaves it | 396 of 400 in order — the four wholly inside rotated |
 * | the polygon as its JSON spells it, through `Math.fround` | 79 of 400 exact: the world polygon carries the bone's matrix (`b` is `cos 90°` at the runtime's pi, −2.3e-8) |
 * | the intersection from the clip edge, `p + u·(q − p)` | 228 of 300 on a horizontal edge at y = 0, where `s + t·(e − s)` read 300 |
 * | the UV weights by a division rather than a reciprocal | 586 of 600 |
 * | the UV weights relative to `a` (`wb, wc` solved, `wa = 1 − wb − wc`) | 105 of 600 |
 *
 * ## What is not posed, and why
 *
 * The block is left out, naming the slot, when a clip that starts is one of:
 *
 * - ⚠️ **not strictly convex** — a reflex vertex, three collinear vertices or
 *   a repeated one. The runtime decomposes such a polygon into convex pieces
 *   and clips each triangle against each piece in turn: a covering triangle
 *   read the pieces (a notched square into three triangles, an L into two
 *   quads; a collinear vertex dropped; a repeated vertex clipped everything
 *   away). Which pieces, in which order and from which vertex is the
 *   runtime's own decomposition, and the dump alone did not fix it (issue
 *   #964's report). Posing it would be guessing an algorithm.
 * - **`inverse`** — the clip keeps what is outside the polygon, through a
 *   decomposition of the triangle around it (a covering triangle came back as
 *   fifteen vertices in five fans). Not measured past that.
 *
 * What the core DRAWS under such a clip — a decomposition of its own, the
 * `clipped` block still left out — is the last section of this file
 * (`clipThrough`, issue #964).
 *
 * `convex: true` on a strictly convex polygon changes nothing: 400 of 400
 * cases byte-identical with and without it. On a polygon that is not, the
 * runtime clips against its convex hull (a notched square with `convex` read
 * as the square); that is the first case above and is left out.
