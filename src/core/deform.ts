/**
 * Construct 4 of the core, its remainder (issue #955, step 2f of issue #380):
 * the two timelines an attachment carries — `deform`, a vertex attachment's
 * vertices keyed over time, and `sequence`, the frame a region's series shows
 * — at a sample time, and under a slider at the time and mix it was applied
 * with.
 *
 * Every rule below was measured by posing hand-written skeletons through
 * `tools/pose_oracle.ts dump` (spine-core 4.3.13, `--skin all`,
 * `--physics none`) and comparing a formula over the core's own world
 * transforms (`./world.ts`, exact on every probe) with the rows the dump
 * printed, at the oracle's six-decimal rounding. Nothing here was written
 * from the runtime's source. The core suite's `CD` controls hold the same
 * skeletons against the core at tolerance 0.
 *
 * ## Deform: what a key holds
 *
 * A key states a run — `vertices`, starting at `offset` (0 unstated) — into
 * the attachment's deform array: one `x, y` pair per vertex of an unweighted
 * attachment, one pair per BINDING of a weighted one (in vertex order, then
 * binding order). What the run does not cover is an offset of 0, and a key
 * with no `vertices` is all zeros — the setup geometry.
 *
 * - **Unweighted, the runtime holds the key as positions, each the float32 sum
 *   `fround(fround(setup) + fround(offset))`.** Over 800 samples of 40
 *   random meshes on rotated, scaled bones, five-decimal numbers: that
 *   reading 0 misses; the double sum lerped 788, the lerped positions
 *   rounded to float32 791, the offsets lerped and then added 788.
 * - **Weighted, the runtime holds the key as offsets** (`fround(offset)`) and
 *   adds each to its binding's float32 coordinate when the world vertices
 *   are computed: `(fround(bx) + dx)·a + (fround(by) + dy)·b + worldX`, times
 *   the weight, summed. Over 1,600 samples of 80 random meshes over one to
 *   three of three bones: 0 misses; the float32 sum held as a position 775
 *   and 780, the lerped offset rounded to float32 711 and 716.
 *
 * ## Deform: at a sample time
 *
 * The key search is construct 4's (the last key at or before `t`, key times
 * float32). Before the first key the setup geometry; at or after the last
 * key, and on a `stepped` segment, that key; between two keys the lerp
 * `a + (b − a)·p` of the two held arrays, in double — measured above, and on
 * 7,200 samples of 180 random multi-key timelines (runs short and offset,
 * keys without vertices, stepped, linear and Bézier segments): 0 misses with
 * the Bézier rule below, 114 with the far end 1, every one on a Bézier
 * piece next to the eighth or ninth point. The form `a·(1 − p) + b·p` read
 * the same 0: the two differ below the oracle's grid, so which one the
 * runtime writes is not measurable here, and the first is taken.
 *
 * - **Linear**: `p = (t − t0) / (t1 − t0)`, the key times float32 (a float32
 *   `p` missed 341 of 2,400).
 * - **Bézier**: one channel whose value axis runs from 0 to 1 — the fraction
 *   of the way from one key's geometry to the next — shaped as a bone
 *   channel's is (`bezierPolyline` in `./animation.ts`: the polyline through
 *   the cubic's nine points at tenths of its parameter, stated numbers,
 *   float32 points) with ONE measured difference: ⚠️ **the recurrence runs to
 *   a far end of `0.99999999`, not 1, while the polyline's last point is the
 *   next key at 1.** Read off 126 curves, each point fixed by intersecting
 *   the two pieces meeting at it (a 10⁵-unit run makes `p` legible to 1e-11):
 *   with the far end 1 the points missed 64 of 1,134; with `0.99999999`, 1 —
 *   a first point whose piece held too few samples to fit — and every other
 *   far end tried missed more (1 − 2⁻²⁷ 17, 0.999999989 10, 0.99999998 68;
 *   the exact one-sixth with the far end 1, 68). On the 1,080 points of the
 *   120 random curves among them, the other readings of the recurrence
 *   missed more still: float32 handles 222, float32 running sums or
 *   constants 258 and more (1,024 combinations tried), the cubic evaluated
 *   directly 67. The residual the far end 1 leaves is one float32 step,
 *   always downward, growing with the point's index. A bone
 *   channel shaped by the same handles read the far end 1 (`CD02` holds
 *   both): the deform curve is its own reading. The last piece, from the
 *   ninth point to the next key, read exact.
 *
 * ## Under a slider
 *
 * A slider applies its animation's deforms after the sample's own, at its
 * time, from the CURRENT deform — the sample's, or the setup geometry where
 * the sample set none (the setup positions unweighted, zero offsets
 * weighted) — with alpha its mix: `current + (target − current)·mix`, and
 * `additive` `current + (target − setup)·mix` (the setup positions
 * unweighted, zeros weighted). Before the timeline's first key it writes
 * nothing. Measured on 300 samples of 60 random rigs — weighted and not,
 * additive and not, mix 1, 0.5 and in [−1, 2], with and without a deform in
 * the sample's own animation: 0 misses; reading the non-additive blend from
 * the setup geometry missed 45, reading additive as the key's positions
 * added missed 100.
 *
 * ## Which slot a deform timeline moves
 *
 * The timeline names a skin, a slot and a placeholder: a RECORD. It moves
 * every slot whose shown record at that moment — after the attachment
 * timelines and the sliders — is that record, or a linked mesh that plays
 * that record's timelines (`timelines` true), whichever slot the timeline is
 * filed under. Measured (`CD07`): a deform keyed on mesh `m` of slot `y`
 * moved a linked mesh of `m` in slot `x` and another in slot `z`, and moved
 * `x` while `y` showed another mesh and while `y` showed nothing; a linked
 * mesh with `timelines` false did not move; a deform keyed on an attachment
 * the slot shows only between two attachment keys moved it there alone.
 *
 * ## A switch
 *
 * The sample's own attachment timelines are applied before its deform and
 * sequence timelines, so those are matched against what the slot shows after
 * the sample's switches. A slider applies its animation after the sample —
 * its attachment key, then its deform and sequence keys — and ⚠️ **a slider
 * switching the slot to ANOTHER attachment clears the deform and the frame
 * the sample set**, while one naming the attachment already shown keeps
 * them. Measured on two meshes `m`, `n` and on two series `r` (setup frame 1)
 * and `q` (setup frame 2) (`CD14`): a slider switching `m` to `n` over a
 * sample deforming `m` drew `n` undeformed, and over a sample deforming `n`
 * drew `n` undeformed too (the sample's deform of `n` found `m` shown); a
 * slider naming `m` over a sample deforming `m` kept the deform; a slider
 * switching to `n` and deforming it drew its own deform; the series alike —
 * `q` at its setup frame after the switch, `r` at the sample's frame 3 when
 * the slider named `r`. ⚠️ Under
 * `--skin all` a placeholder several skins fill shows the LAST of them in the
 * Spine file's skin order, which the model does not hold (the slots' ⚠️ in
 * `./index.ts`), so a timeline keyed on such a placeholder is not posed: the
 * block is absent, naming it.
 *
 * ## Sequence
 *
 * A region's series shows its setup frame (`sequence.setup`, 0 unstated)
 * until a sequence timeline's first key. From a key — `mode` (`hold`
 * unstated), `index` (0 unstated), `delay` (⚠️ unstated, the key before
 * it's, 0 on the first key) — the frame is `index` plus
 * `floor((t − time) / delay + 0.00001)` steps when `delay` is above 0 (no
 * step otherwise, and none in `hold`), then per mode over `count` frames:
 * `hold` the index held at the last frame, `once` the same, `loop` modulo
 * `count`, `pingpong` modulo `2·(count − 1)` folded back, and each
 * `…Reverse` mode the forward mode's frame `f` read as `count − 1 − f`. The
 * key time and `delay` are float32. Measured on 74,041 samples of 380
 * random timelines, 300 of them with delays built to put the quotient within
 * 1e-6 to 4e-5 of a whole step (52,768 samples): the epsilon 0.00001 missed
 * 0; no epsilon 440, 0.0001 1,266, a float32 quotient 306; on the 52,768,
 * 0.000005 148 and 0.00002 248. ⚠️ **A key stating no
 * delay steps by the key before it's**, carried through keys that state
 * none: a hold with delay 0.2, then a hold at index 1, then a loop at index 0
 * stating no delay stepped every 0.2 from the third key; a delay of 0 stated
 * after one of 0.2 held; the index and the mode are not carried (a key
 * stating no index after one at 3 showed frame 0; one stating no mode
 * after a loop held). A slider applies a
 * sequence key at any mix but 0. Only a region's corners read the frame (its
 * rectangle, `sequence.atlas[frame]`); a mesh's vertices read no atlas.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * As the rest of the core: nothing from the Spine runtime package, nothing
 * from `src/transform.ts`, no clock, no randomness, no I/O.
