 * What a render is, whichever poser draws it — everything `./render.ts` held
 * that does not link spine-core (issue #1052, step 4e of #380).
 *
 * Moved unchanged: the frame-set contract (`frames.json`, the contact sheet),
 * the posing seam and its samplers, the candidate a render or a check loads
 * and its poser choice, the geometry export, texture substitution, the framing
 * and the rasteriser. `./render.ts` keeps what names the runtime — spine-core's
 * implementation of the seam, loading a Spine export, the atlas class — and
 * re-exports every name below that it exported before, so a dependant's import
 * resolves where it always did. See `./render.ts`'s header for what the
 * rasteriser draws and the conventions it owns; they are this file's now.
 *
 * ⭐ Where a function here reaches an input only the runtime can read — a
 * Spine export, `--poser spine`, a fallback the poser line names, a skeleton
 * spine-core already parsed — it asks the seam (`./spine_side.ts`) for the
 * Spine side rather than importing it. The local functions under *the Spine
 * side, through the seam* below carry the names the bodies always called, so
 * the bodies read as they did; `./render.ts` registers the implementations
 * when it is loaded. An entry that never loads it links nothing of the
 * runtime here, and such an input is refused by name (`SpineRuntimeError`).

// tree `check` draws its chains from, the skin roster the framing reads, and
// the atlas pages the rasteriser samples. Until issue #1014 every one of them
// came off the skeleton spine-core had parsed, so a rigc build the core poses
// still loaded and ran the runtime before its poser was chosen. Now the choice
// comes first (`loadCandidate`), and a build the core poses reads each fact
// where it is written: the names, the tree, the subset's roster and the stage
// off the skeleton's own JSON (`skeletonFacts`), the pages off rigc's atlas
// reader, and the skin roster off the model document (`coreSkinRoster` in
// `./render_core.ts`). Every one of those readings was measured equal to the
// spine-core reading it replaces on every input the tree carries — the
// nineteen built corpus rows and the twelve editor exports (the PR of #1014
// carries the counts). A Spine export, `--poser spine` and a fallback the
// poser line names load spine-core as before and read every fact off it.
//
// Since issue #1020 a build the core poses reads what its model document
// states off the document (`coreFacts`): the bone tree, the slot list and the
// subset's roster, and the page images by the names its `pages` section gives
// — so with a `rigc-compiled/2` document the atlas file is not needed at all.
// Since issue #1026 a `rigc-compiled/3` document also states what only the
// Spine files held — the order the animations and skins are listed in (the
// emitter's, not the model's), the stage, and each page's `scale:` line — so

//
// - the setup pose, under a skin or under none;
// - an animation's frames at `i/fps` for `i = 0..count`, one continuous
//   trajectory stepped once per frame (the stepping recipe is the
//   implementation's; the schedule — which `i`, what `count`, what time a
//   frame is filed under — is the sampler's, and stays here);
// - per posed frame: the pieces in draw order (world vertices, page UVs,
//   triangles, tint, dark, page, clip output), the bone snapshots, and every
//   slot's whole attachment geometry;
// - the rest table, and the names a geometry file and a slot subset read.
//
// The framing samples are not a fourth entry: `framingViewport` is the same
// animation entry at `FRAMING_FPS` with the clip off.
//
// 🔒 What stays spine-core's and outside the seam, deliberately: an export's
// atlas (`posableFromText`'s pages, and `substituteTexture`'s region lookup on
// anything spine-core poses — a rigc build the core poses reads both through
// rigc's own reader since issue #1020) and `posedNumbersOf`, which `validate.ts` calls on a spine-core

 * `page` and `uvs` change, and they change through the drawing's own coordinates
 * (`PieceTexture`), so the same point of the artwork lands at the same world

 * source.
 *
 * That is what `rigc check --atlas <the frames' own atlas>` was being used for and
 * is not: pointing `--atlas` at another atlas re-loads the skeleton against it, and
 * a region attachment's quad is derived from the region rectangle, so a `rotate:`
 * or a trim in the substituting pack moves the geometry too. Measured on rung 7,
 * whose pack is `rotate: 270` and trimmed: that swap sends the reported MAE **up**
 * on every set, which a texture floor cannot do — a coarser texture can only
 * explain error, never add it (issue #199).
 *
 * ## The window
 *
 * A trimmed pack keeps only the drawing's opaque sub-rectangle, while the
 * candidate's own quad spans the whole drawing. Art-space coordinates outside what
 * the pack kept map to page texels **belonging to whatever was packed next door**,
 * so the substituted piece is fenced to its own rectangle (`UvWindow`) and draws
 * nothing outside it. That is the faithful answer rather than a convenience: a
 * packer trims only fully transparent border, so outside the rectangle the drawing

 * existed.
 *
 * With one, the light colour multiplies the texel and the dark colour fills in

 * two-colour fragment shader, `spine-ts/spine-webgl/src/Shader.ts`

 * the file and four bytes on the vertex. `SkeletonRendererCore` packs it as such:
 * `darkColor = 0xff000000 | …` on the `pma` branch and `darkColor = (r << 16) |
 * (g << 8) | b` — alpha byte **zero** — on the other. This rasteriser composites
 * **straight** alpha (see `premultiplied` below), so the flag is 0 and the shader
 * reduces to the two terms this function computes. Reading `dark.a` out of the
 * file here would be reading a flag as a colour.
 *
 * The clamp is on the dark path only, for the same reason: `sample * light` is
 * already inside the range whenever `light` is, and a clamp on that path would

/**
 * Sample a straight-alpha page bilinearly — interpolating in PREMULTIPLIED space.
 *
 * ⭐ **Why the premultiply.** The source is straight alpha, so a transparent
 * texel beside the art is `(0, 0, 0, 0)`: its colour is not a colour, it is the
 * absence of one. Averaging R, G and B against it pulls the sample toward black
 * while alpha only drops part of the way, and the difference between those two
 * rates IS a dark rim, one pixel wide, drawn over whatever is behind the part.
 * Weighting each colour by its own alpha and dividing the sum back out gives the
 * transparent texel no vote in the colour, which is the whole of the fix: two
 * parts of one colour, overlapping, come out that colour. Measured before the
 * fix at −60/255 between two parts sharing one flat field, and −31/255 down
 * `gallery/portrait`'s forehead — issue #292.
 *
 * ⭐ **Why alpha is computed the old way, and why equal alpha short-circuits.**
 * `rasteriseQuad` and `rasteriseMesh` gate coverage on `alpha > 0.5`, so the
 * alpha arithmetic decides WHICH pixels are drawn — and through `frameGeometry`,
 * the framing box every reference frame was rendered inside. `lerpTap` on the
 * alpha channel is therefore the original expression, unchanged, not an
 * algebraically equal rearrangement: equal-but-rearranged is a last-bit
 * difference, and a last bit either side of 0.5 is a pixel.
 *
 * For the same reason the equal-alpha case returns early. When all four taps
 * carry one alpha, premultiplying by it and dividing it back out is the identity
 * — so the straight path is not an approximation there, it is the same number,
 * and taking it reproduces the five committed rungs BIT for bit rather than
 * merely closely. What moves is exactly the mixed-alpha tap: the edges, where the
 * rim was.

 * production caller until #306: `src/pose.ts`'s `errBilinear`, on the argument
 * that `materialPlate`'s fourth channel is a material mask rather than opacity.
 * That argument was wrong in the direction that mattered — the mask is exactly
 * the weight the colour wanted, because a texel with no material carries the
 * background's colour and not the part's — so `errBilinear` now takes
 * `bilinear` too, and the only importer left is `selftest.ts`.
 *
 * ⭐ It lives here rather than in the suite so the control shares `taps` — the
 * edge clamp above — with the sampler it is a control for. A hand copy in the
 * test file would drift from it silently, and then `SM01` would be comparing the
 * fix against something that is not what the renderer used to do.
 * `SM08_NO_PRODUCTION_MODULE_READS_THE_STRAIGHT_TAP` is what keeps the first
