/**
 * The round trip's rules, restated over the text rigc emitted (issue #1060,
 * step 4e of #380) — the half of the gate the entry that links none of
 * spine-core runs beside the model side (`../model/index.ts`).
 *
 * ⭐ **Every one of the 49 is accounted for, by name.** The model side runs
 * the moved assertions (`MOVED_ASSERTIONS`) over the document. What is left —
 * the complement, read off `ASSERTION_KIND` rather than listed — is the
 * round trip's own: A00, A01, A02, A05, A07, A16, A18, A31, A35 at the time of
 * writing. Each of those but one reads the raw text, not what spine-core
 * loaded: the atlas's line layout (A07), the skeleton JSON's draw-order
 * offsets, deform runs, version label, legacy arrays, legacy bone key and
 * curve arrays (A31, A35, A16, A01, A02, A05), and A18's second compile. So
 * each is restated here over the same text, by a body under `../bodies/` that
 * is the round trip's clause word for word, and prints the round trip's line
 * (`RC28` holds the two on every recipe and on each assertion's mutants).
 * The one that cannot be is **A00**: it is spine-core's parser loading the
 * pair, and there is no second reader of the format to stand in for it. It
 * SKIPs, naming spine-core and where the round trip does run — never a PASS
 * on nothing. A code the complement grows by that this file does not know is
 * an internal error, so a new round-trip rule cannot go unrun here in silence.
 *
 * Links nothing from the runtime.
