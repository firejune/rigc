/**
 * The harness an assertion body runs in, and the report it fills (issue
 * #1025, step 4c of #380).
 *
 * One harness for both sides. `validate()` runs a body over the facts it reads
 * off what spine-core loaded; the model side (`./model/index.ts`) runs the same
 * body over the facts it reads off the model document and the core. What makes
 * a line the same line on both sides is that the body is one function and the
 * harness deciding PASS, SKIP, FAIL and PROF around it is one function too — a
 * second copy of `check` would be a second place a verdict could be decided
 * differently.
 *
 * Moved here from `validate()`, the rule unchanged: an assertion is recorded
 * as passed only when its body neither failed nor skipped, a body that throws
 * is a FAIL whose detail is `threw: <message>`, and a rule the profile does not
 * carry is not run at all and is recorded as out of profile.
 *
 * This module links nothing from the runtime, directly or through what it
 * imports — the condition for the model side to use it, held by the selftest.
