/**
 * What the build declared, read off the document (issue #1054): the rig info
 * the archetype and declaration rules read, and each animation's declared
 * duration, which A09 holds the keys against.
 *
 * ⭐ **The document is the one source, on every spec it is read at.** A
 * `rigc-compiled/3`, `/2` and `/1` document all carry the `rig` section
 * (`CompileResult.rig` as `modelDocument` writes it) and every animation's
 * `duration` (the motion spec's, which `readModel` reads as
 * `CoreAnimationTimelines.declared` and refuses when it is not a finite
 * number). Until this module the model side took both from its caller, as
 * `validate()` does, and its verdict moved with what the caller handed it:
 * measured over the 19 recipes with the document's own values left out, A09
 * read SKIP on 38 of 38 cells, ten rules read their bare-directory SKIP, and
 * A20 read FAIL on 7 cells where it reads PASS — without the rig every mesh is
 * judged a generated ring (`meshKindOf`), so an authored mesh fails the
 * generator policy. A value the document states is read from the document,
 * and the same value given beside it is refused by name
 * (`refuseDeclaredBeside`), as issue #1026 made the stage and `pma`
 * (`./given.ts`).
 *
 * 🔒 **The rig section is read field by field, never cast.** A body reads a
 * declaration only through `modelRigInfo`, which refuses by its path a field
 * that is missing, of the wrong type or not one the writer writes — the
 * model side's parse runs it (`./parse.ts`, `A00_MODEL_READ`), so a document
 * whose declarations are malformed is refused where the reader refuses, and
 * never judged against a guess.
 *
 * Links nothing from the runtime.
