/**
 * repack — a packed build's own output lifted back into parts, and the two
 * comparisons that say a repack of it lost nothing (issue #1169).
 *
 * `rigc repack <build>` (`src/cli/repack.ts`) is three steps a consumer that
 * keeps only `skeleton.json`, `skeleton.atlas` and the page PNGs worked out by
 * hand: cut every region off its page by its atlas bounds, `ingest` the
 * skeleton with `--art loose`, `build --pack` from the two specs and the cut
 * parts. This module is the half of that which is not a command: what the
 * atlas has to look like for the cut to be exact (`atlasRefusals`), the cut
 * itself (`liftAtlas`, which is `extractRegion` per region), and the two
 * comparisons the command makes before it writes anything — every region
 * lifted off the NEW pages against the same region lifted off the OLD ones
 * (`regionDifferences`), and the rebuilt skeleton against the input's
 * (`skeletonDifferences`). The third check is the gate, which is `build`'s and
 * is not restated here.
 *
 * ## What "exact" means, and why each refusal is one
 *
 * A region is lifted to `originalWidth x originalHeight` with its kept
 * rectangle at its trim offset and the rest transparent (`extractRegion`), so
 * a turned region (`rotate: 90`, `180`, `270`) and a region trimmed of
 * whitespace (`offsets:`) come off the page as the drawing the runtime draws —
 * `PKR02` holds that mapping against spine-core's sampling on every corpus
 * region. rigc's packer then places that drawing unturned and untrimmed, which
 * is a change of PLACEMENT only: the pack owns placement.
 *
 * What it cannot carry is anything the repacked atlas would state differently
 * besides placement, because `writeAtlasText` writes exactly `size`, `filter:
 * Linear, Linear` and `pma: false` per page and `bounds`, `offsets` and
 * `rotate: 0` per region. So a page that states anything else — `scale:` other
 * than 1 (the texels are coarser than the drawings, and the repacked page would
 * say they are not), `pma: true` (the texels are premultiplied, and the
 * repacked page would say they are straight), another `filter`, a `format` or
 * a `repeat` — and a region that states `index`, `split` or `pad` are refused
 * by name: the repack would drop or contradict a fact the input states. A
 * region the atlas names twice, or two names one case-insensitive file system
 * writes to one file, cannot be lifted to one part per name. A region whose
 * rectangle leaves its page, whose offsets leave its drawing, or whose page
 * PNG is missing or not the size the atlas declares, would be lifted from
 * texels the atlas does not describe.
 *
 * 🔒 Every refusal is collected before the first file is written, and the
 * command writes nothing when there is one. Nothing here guesses: there is no
 * "close enough" cut.
 *
 * No clock, no randomness, no network, no spine-core. It reads the pages it is
 * pointed at (`readPlate`), as `compile` reads the parts.
