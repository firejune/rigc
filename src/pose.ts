/**
 * pose — where each loose part sits in one pose frame.
 *
 * ⭐ This is an ENTRY instrument, and the distinction decides every choice below.
 * The user hands over a condition — "here is the pose I want" as a picture — and
 * an agent has to turn it into spec coordinates. Nothing here grades anything:
 * the poses become inputs the spec then states by construction, so no pass bar
 * attaches to any number this file produces. The residual exists so the agent
 * knows **how much to trust** a placement and **where two answers are equally
 * good**, which is a different job from scoring and needs the opposite defaults.
 *
 * What that means in practice: a refusal names the part and the reason and still
 * prints the best it found, an ambiguity reports BOTH optima rather than picking,
 * and a part whose rotation genuinely does not matter is reported as having a free
 * degree of freedom instead of a bad one.
 *
 * 🔍 The estimator. For every part PNG it searches the rigid family
 * (translation, one rotation, one uniform scale) for the placement whose pixels
 * best explain the frame's pixels **inside the part's own alpha footprint**. The
 * objective is an alpha-weighted mean absolute colour error in 0..1:
 *
 *   err(part pixel) = material · |partRGB − frameRGB| / 255   +   (1 − material)
 *
 * where `material` is how much of the frame is *not* background there — so a part
 * pixel hanging over the background, or off the canvas entirely, costs the maximum
 * 1 rather than whatever colour distance the background happens to give.
 * Normalising by the part's own alpha weight is what makes residuals comparable
 * between a thumb and a torso.
 *
 * ⚠️ Measuring on the part's own footprint is also the only occlusion robustness
 * here, and it is deliberately not a solver. A part drawn *behind* another in the
 * frame has the occluder's pixels where its own should be, so its residual rises
 * even at the correct placement. `unexplained` separates the two readings: a low
 * residual is a confident placement, a middling residual with a high `unexplained`
 * is usually a correct placement seen through something else. Weigh accordingly;
 * do not read either as a verdict.
 *
 * Coordinates are the frame's own: **frame pixels, y down, origin top-left**, the
 * same convention a cut manifest uses. `rotationDeg` is screen degrees — positive
 * turns clockwise on screen — so `screenToSpineDegrees` in `src/transform.ts` is
 * the one conversion to Spine's y-up CCW world, and `cropToSpineY` the other.
 *
 * ⭐ **This file owns the objective, and `src/chainfit.ts` borrows it rather than
 * holding a second opinion about it.** The pixel machinery below — the background
 * read, the material plate, the alpha-weighted halving, the sample sets and the
 * two error functions — is exported for exactly one caller, whose whole claim is
 * that it is *this* estimator with the occluders taken out of the denominator. Two
 * implementations of "how well does this part explain these pixels" would make the
 * two instruments' residuals incomparable, which is the one thing a caller reading
 * both of them needs them not to be. What `chainfit` does NOT borrow is the search:
 * it has the candidate rig, so it searches one degree of freedom where this file
 * searches four.

//
// ⭐ `bilinear` — the PREMULTIPLIED tap — and the fourth channel is what makes
// that read oddly at first. `materialPlate` hands this file the frame's own RGB
// with alpha rewritten to mean "how much material is here", so the weighting is
// not a colour-space correction here: a texel with no material has no material
// COLOUR either — it carries the background's — so it must get a vote in the
// coverage and none in the colour. That is exactly what premultiplying by the
// fourth channel does, and interpolating the colours channel by channel is what
// mixed the ground into the material along every silhouette (issue #306, the
// same defect class as #292 in the instrument that prices placements).
//
// Both tap paths in this file are colour-against-colour, and neither reads a
// mask as if it were a colour:
//   • the search and `measure` sample the MATERIAL PLATE — mask fourth channel,
//     the frame's own RGB;
//   • `rotationSelfSimilarity` samples the PART plate itself, whose fourth
//     channel is the art's own straight alpha — the #292 case verbatim.
// `bilinear` computes its fourth channel with the unchanged `lerpTap`, so the
// coverage term `errBilinear` gates on is bit-identical to what the
// channel-independent tap returned; only the colour moves, and only where a tap
// straddles an edge. #301 deliberately left this call on the old arithmetic to
// hold the fitting numbers still while the from-zero run 2 was in flight; #306
// moved it, with the re-baseline of every figure that quoted a residual.

 *
 * ⚠️ An eighth, not the quarter it was, and the reason is measured rather than
 * assumed (issue #865). "The objective varies over distances of order the part"
 * is true of a solid part and false of a thin or holey one: a gun whose material

 * missing from the final list; in 38 of them the truth, evaluated exactly at the
 * coarse level, beat every cell of its scale rung, and the anchor CELL holding it

 * grid's. The other four were the refinement's, and since issue #877 all four
 * place at their truth again: the native 48 px arm (walk) at 0.07 px, 48 px
 * goggles (walk) 0.04, 96 px goggles (setup) 0.03 — three polishes stopped in a

 * and the blur1 24 px mouth are found again too.
 *

 * 🔍 What the pattern search cannot do, and the trace table of issue #877 is
 * how it was seen: every probe moves ONE degree of freedom, and the objective
 * couples scale to position along a diagonal valley — a part shrunk a little
 * fits best a pixel or two off its truth, so from there every single-axis probe
 * is worse and every joint move is better. In 12 of the 14 missed trials the

 * polish stopped 2–7 px off it at a scale of 0.64–0.96. Not one polish ever
 * accepted a worse residual — a polish moves only on a strictly lower probe of
 * its own level's objective, and `PO26` holds that — so the rise from one level
 * to the next is a change of objective, never a step taken uphill.
 *
 * ⭐ So the escape re-fits position at the new scale before comparing — the

 * uncovered, so a shrunk placement is the cheap error the reduced levels make —
 * every stuck point in the table sat below scale 1, none above.

 * reports a second placement 1.8 px off at scale 0.825 within the ambiguity
 * margin, and the blurred 24 px front shin (walk) now places AT its truth
 * (0.03 px, 0.00989) where it placed 0.57 px off at 0.0191 — the old answer is
 * still reported beside it, 0.0094 above, inside the 0.01 absolute margin.
 *
 * 🔍 The quarter rung is issue #886, and the fixed-scale profile is what
 * named it. MOTION.md §6's post (14x96, pose A, `--scale 0.85,1.2`) came back
 * at scale 0.917 and residual 0.0649 where the page had recorded 0.975 at
 * 0.0589 — the old placement still scores 0.0589 on this objective, so the
 * search missed it. The trace: the coarse cell nearest the truth (2.4 px off
 * it, at the 2x level) kept a half-turned post, its polish ended 6.7 px from
 * the truth, the full-resolution rotation re-grid set it upright there, and
 * the polish climbed the scale–position valley to 0.917.
 * The half-rung escape then tried 1.029: best position there 0.0980, worse
 * than 0.0649, so it declined — while the best position at every scale
 * between 0.94 and 1.00 scores 0.0619–0.0589. A part whose material fills its
 * image pays for every pixel pushed past the figure, so its profile above the
 * truth is a cliff, and half a rung stepped over the basin onto it. A quarter
 * rung lands at 0.971 (0.0593, 0.1 px off the page's placement).
 *
 * 📏 Both, not the quarter alone, and measured on the grid rather than argued:
 * the quarter alone found 234 (3 gained, 6 lost — the native arms #877 was
 * made for need the half); half then quarter, the quarter tried only when the
 * half declines, 237 (1, 1); both, the better kept, 238 (2 gained, 1 lost) and
 * misses 8 → 6, for 16% more user CPU over the grid. The one it loses is a
 * margin reading of the kind named above: the blurred 32 px front shin (walk)
 * now reports its truth as its BEST (0.07 px, 0.00968) with the old 0.51 px

/**
 * Every anchor cell of the coarse level, holding the best (rotation, scale) found
 * for it.
 *
 * A per-cell best rather than a global top-K, because the thing this instrument
 * must not lose is the SECOND place a part could sit — and a global top-K fills
 * up with a hundred neighbours of the single best cell before it ever reaches it.
 *
 * 📏 ONE rotation per cell, and issue #892 measured what that costs rather than
 * assuming it. Over `tools/pose_floor.ts`'s 420 trials, the coarse seed nearest
 * the truth is within 2.4 px of it and a half-turn off on 2 of the 238 found
 * trials (both a mouth at 48 px, both found anyway) and on none of the 6
 * misses; every failed trial whose nearest seed is a quarter- or half-turn off
 * but one is a flat part, and none of those 26 is a miss: each is the objective
 * preferring another placement or the truth reported and tied. MOTION.md
 * §6's post is the one case, and a second rotation per cell would not reach it:
 * at its nearest cell the upright rung scores 0.305 against the half-turn's
 * 0.168 — 1.8 times, wider than the 1.73 band `REFINE_CANDIDATES` rejected.
 * The other two levers the card named were measured on the grid and lost found
 * trials outside the ambiguity margin: re-gridding rotation at this level
 * rather than the next (238 → 236: 7 gained, 9 lost, six of them native, three
 * guns now 37–151 px off), and suppressing minima only within a rotation family
 * (238 → 231: 2 gained, 10 lost, among them the 48 px fist `PO23` holds).
