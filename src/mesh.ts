/**
 * Procedural mesh geometry — three builders, two different jobs.
 *
 * `buildRingMesh` and `buildRibbonMesh` build the shape a DEFORMATION asks for,
 * and the long note below is theirs: what is pinned, what may move, how
 * authority falls off. `buildContourMesh` builds the shape the ART already is —
 * it traces a part's own alpha and triangulates it, and its own section further
 * down says why that makes it a shape rather than a deformation model.
 *
 * ## The ring and the ribbon
 *
 * The shape they build is the one a deformable aperture asks for: **the rim is
 * nailed down and only the inside moves.** For a face cut that ring is the mouth
 * aperture, and the rim already exists as data — the mask polygon in the cut
 * manifest is exactly the contour where the generated part fades into untouched
 * base pixels. Pin those vertices to the slot bone at weight 1 and the seam
 * cannot move, which is the whole reason a mesh is safe here at all.
 *
 * Three rings and a hub:
 *
 *     rim ring    = the part WINDOW edge            weight 1.0 -> anchor bone
 *     seam ring   = the manifest polygon            weight 1.0 -> anchor bone
 *     inner ring  = the polygon scaled toward the   weight w   -> control bone
 *                   aperture centre by `inner`
 *     hub         = the aperture centre             weight 1.0 -> control bone
 *
 * The rim ring is not decoration and the first cut of this code did not have it.
 * A generated part carries alpha well OUTSIDE its mask polygon — thousands of
 * pixels of it, on the one this was measured against — and that band is the
 * feather, the soft ramp that makes generated pixels blend into the base at all.
 * A mesh whose outer ring is the polygon simply does not draw them, and a render
 * probe caught exactly that: a halo of difference reaching several pixels past
 * the polygon, versus the rigid build of the same part. So the
 * mesh covers the whole region (rim ring on the window edge, uv 0 and 1) and the
 * polygon becomes an interior ring — pinned, because it is still the seam.
 *
 * The control bone carries every key, so key count is independent of vertex
 * count and a physics constraint could later be hung on the same bone for free.
 * There are no deform timelines: deforming the vertices directly is the fallback
 * for when procedural weighting fails, and it has not.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and integer-stable: same manifest in, same floats out
 * (assertion A18 recompiles and compares bytes).

/**
 * Ear clipping over one strictly simple polygon, concave welcome.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Repeatedly find a vertex whose two edges make a convex turn in the polygon's
 * own winding and whose triangle holds no other vertex, emit it as a triangle,
 * and remove it. The emitted triples carry the polygon's own winding, so a
 * clockwise-on-screen outline yields triangles that are counter-clockwise in
 * Spine world after the y flip — the convention the rest of this file keeps.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and why by name
 *
 * - **Holes.** There is no bridging step here, so a polygon is an outline and
 *   nothing else. `traceAlphaOutline` therefore hands over the OUTER boundary and
 *   reports the enclosed transparent area rather than cutting it out; those
 *   pixels are inside the mesh and draw nothing, because their alpha is still 0.
 * - **Self-intersection**, including a polygon that merely touches itself:
 *   refused upstream by `findSelfIntersection`, because the two-ears theorem — the
 *   guarantee that this loop terminates — is a statement about a strictly simple
 *   polygon.
 * - **No ear found** while three or more vertices remain. On a strictly simple
 *   polygon that cannot happen, so reaching it means an input this function was
 *   promised it would not get, and it says so instead of emitting a fan of
 *   slivers that would load and render as folded art.
 *
 * O(n²) per ear, O(n³) overall, and deliberately so: `maxVertices` bounds n at
 * the tens, an outline that needs thousands of vertices is not a mesh anybody
 * wants in a runtime's inner loop, and a sweep-line would be a second geometry
 * kernel to be wrong in.

 * Trace the outer boundary of the largest island of art, on the pixel-CORNER

 * ## Why the corner lattice and not the pixel centres
 *
 * A contour through pixel centres runs half a pixel inside the art all the way
 * round, so the outermost row of every edge falls outside the mesh — a mesh that
 * clips the art by half a pixel everywhere, which is exactly the defect this
 * whole builder has to not have. On the corner lattice the traced polygon
 * encloses every art pixel's full square, so the raw trace clips nothing at all
 * and everything after it is a controlled retreat from that.
 *
 * ## The walk
 *
 * Each art pixel whose neighbour is background contributes one directed "crack"
 * along the shared edge, wound so that the art stays on the walker's right: top
 * edge to +x, right edge to +y, bottom to -x, left to -y. Those cracks form
 * closed loops. Starting at the first art pixel in row order — whose top
 * neighbour is background by construction — and always taking the sharpest
 * clockwise turn available walks the island's outer loop.
 *
 * ⚠️ The clockwise rule is not a preference. At a corner where two art pixels
 * meet diagonally, two cracks leave the same point and the choice decides whether
 * the walk treats the diagonal as connected. Clockwise keeps it disconnected,
 * which is the same 4-connectivity `labelIslands` used — the alternative would
 * trace a boundary for an island the labelling says is two.

 * The same measurement for geometry rigc did NOT build — issue #277.

 * ## Why an authored mesh can be measured at all
 *
 * Issue #44's lesson was that rigc must not apply a GENERATOR's topology rules to
 * authored geometry: where a rim is, how rows pair, which edge is pinned. It did
 * not build the mesh, so it cannot know any of that. Coverage is not topology.
 * It is a number between two things the compiler has in front of it — the emitted
 * triangles, and the PNG the attachment names with `image` — and it assumes
 * nothing whatever about how the vertices are arranged. The defect it catches is
 * the renderer's, not the author's: texture outside the triangles is not drawn,
 * so art outside the mesh disappears on every runtime. A 9-vertex fan whose 8 rim
 * vertices sit exactly on a round part's silhouette loses its whole ink outline
 * between the spokes — an octagon's sides pass `R·cos(π/8)` from its centre — and
 * measured 94.31%, five points under the bar the same art would have been refused
 * at as a `contour`, with nothing in the report saying so.
 *
 * ## Two differences from `measureContourFit`, both deliberate
 *
 * **The filled silhouette is ALL the art plus what it encloses**, not the largest
 * island plus what that encloses. A contour is one traced loop and can only ever
 * enclose one island; an authored mesh over a part drawn as several islands is
 * ordinary, correct data.
 *
 * **The overshoot search has no radius.** `measureContourFit` bounds it because a
 * contour past its bound is refused and needs no exact figure. An authored mesh
 * is never refused, so every figure needs a number — hence the exact distance
 * transform below rather than a neighbourhood search that would have to stop
 * somewhere.

// a mesh it has to guess an outline for — which it does by declaring EVERY
// vertex a hull vertex, in list order, and saying so in a WARNING on import.

// The triangles already fix the outline: an edge used by exactly one triangle
// is on it, an edge shared by two is interior. `traceOutline` reads that off,
// `checkHullOrder` asks whether the vertex list is arranged the way `hull` needs
