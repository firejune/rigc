/**
 * The rasteriser — one code path for reference frames and for candidates.
 *
 * ⭐ Why this is a module and not a script. `bench/render_reference.ts` renders
 * the official export to the PNG frames an authoring agent is allowed to see;
 * `rigc check` renders the agent's own candidate and compares it against those
 * frames. If those two drew pixels differently, every number `check` reports
 * would carry the difference between two renderers on top of the difference
 * between two rigs — and the second is the only one anybody wants to read. So
 * there is exactly one rasteriser, and both callers are thin.
 *
 * ## What it draws
 *
 * Region and mesh attachments, in draw order, tinted by slot colour x attachment
 * colour. Both are **affine** texture maps and neither divides by w:
 *
 * - a **region** is one quad. `spine-core` computes its four world vertices on
 *   the CPU, a destination pixel maps back into the region's rectangle by
 *   inverting one 2x2, and there is no triangle split at all;
 * - a **mesh** is a triangle list. `MeshAttachment.computeWorldVertices` does the
 *   work — it is the runtime's own routine, so weighted vertices resolve through
 *   their bones and a `deform` timeline's offsets are applied, exactly the way a
 *   real runtime would. Each triangle is then filled with barycentric UV
 *   interpolation.
 *
 * A **clipping attachment** draws no pixel of its own and removes the pixels of
 * every slot from the one carrying it through its `end` slot. `piecesOf` runs
 * spine-core's own `SkeletonClipping` beside the draw-order walk, in the call
 * sequence spine-webgl's `SkeletonRenderer.draw` runs, so a slot inside a clip
 * reaches the rasteriser as the geometry the runtime draws rather than as the
 * attachment's whole (issue #844).
 *
 * ⭐ **Sampling is bilinear on both paths, and the source is straight alpha —
 * so the interpolation is premultiplied.** One filter rather than two is not a
 * detail: `check` measures a candidate against reference frames, and a mesh
 * triangle sampled nearest against a reference sampled bilinear would put a
 * filter difference into the residual where only a rig difference belongs.
 * Bilinear rather than nearest because the region path was already bilinear and
 * the five committed rungs are rendered with it.
 *
 * Straight alpha is a property of the SOURCE, not a licence to average it
 * channel by channel: a transparent texel's `(0, 0, 0, 0)` is the absence of a
 * colour, and giving it a vote drew a dark rim along every region edge — over
 * the top of whatever was behind the part, and into `check`'s residual on the
 * candidate side. `bilinear` weights each colour by its own alpha and divides
 * back out; see it for what that does and does not move (issue #292).
 *
 * ⚠️ **Region rasterising is untouched by the mesh path**, deliberately. A region
 * could be drawn as two triangles and very nearly the same pixels would come out;
 * "very nearly" would have silently rewritten five rungs of committed reference
 * frames. `rasteriseQuad` still owns regions, `rasteriseMesh` owns meshes, and
 * `rasterisePiece` picks.
 *
 * ## The fill rule, and why a mesh needs one
 *
 * Two triangles that share an edge must cover the pixels along it exactly once.
 * Include the boundary in both and every interior edge of a mesh blends twice —
 * a visible lattice of seams wherever the art is not opaque. Exclude it in both
 * and the seams become holes.
 *
 * So `rasteriseMesh` normalises each triangle's winding and applies the standard
 * **top-left rule**: a pixel centre exactly on an edge belongs to the triangle
 * only when that edge is a top or a left one. The two triangles sharing an edge
 * traverse it in opposite directions, so exactly one of them calls it top-left —
 * which is the property that makes the rule watertight without an epsilon.
 *
 * ## Two conventions this file owns
 *
 * - **Spine world is y up; an image is y down.** The projection from world to
 *   frame pixels lives in `projector` and nowhere else.
 * - **The framing box is measured at `FRAMING_FPS`, whatever rate frames are
 *   written at.** The union of the posed vertices depends on WHICH TIMES you
 *   sample, so taking it at the output rate made the viewport a property of the
 *   rate: rung 1's `balls` framed to 256x240 at 12 fps and 256x239 at 24 fps.
 *   One pixel is enough to be a trap — the two sets look comparable, an author
 *   measures a distance in one and a time in the other, and the scale between
 *   them is silently off.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two notes on where this sits. It imports `spine-core`, which `src/` is
 * otherwise careful about: posing a skeleton *is* running the runtime, and there
 * is no honest way to render one without it. (Since issue #968 that holds for a
 * Spine export: a rigc build is posed by rigc's own core through
 * `./render_core.ts`, and this file keeps the runtime for the export's poser,
 * the export's atlas pages and texture substitution — see *which poser* below.
 * Since issue #1014 a rigc build the core poses touches none of it: what a
 * render reads off the candidate besides the pose comes from its model
 * document and the skeleton's own JSON (`loadCandidate`), and since issue
 * #1020 its pages and a `--texture-from` atlas through rigc's own reader, so
 * spine-core is reached only where it poses an export or a fallback.) The rule that matters is unchanged
 * — `src/compile.ts` must stay independent of the runtime so the compiler and
 * the gate are not checking each other's assumptions — and this file is neither.
 * It also imports `tools/plate.ts` for the PNG codec, which is dependency-free.
 *
 * ## What is here, and what is not (issue #1052)
 *
 * Only what names the runtime: spine-core's implementation of the posing seam
 * (`spinePoser`), loading a Spine export (`posableFromText`, `loadPosedSkeleton`,
 * and the half of `loadCandidate` an export takes), the atlas class's readings
 * (`atlasPageNames`, the `spine` reader of a texture substitution), and what
 * reads a posed spine-core skeleton (`piecesOf`, `boneSnapshots`,
 * `posedNumbersOf`, the rest table). Everything else — the frame-set contract,
 * the samplers, the candidate and its poser choice, the geometry export, the
 * framing and the rasteriser — is `./render_shared.ts`, which links nothing of
 * the runtime, and every name it holds that this file exported is re-exported
 * from here. That module reaches this one's half through the seam
 * (`./spine_side.ts`): loading this file registers it (`registerSpinePosing`,
 * at the bottom), so every program that imports it renders exactly as before,
 * and one that does not refuses an export by name.

 * The posed drawables of one frame, in draw order.

 * type that is neither is skipped rather than refused: a bounding box, a point
 * and a clipping attachment are all things a rig legitimately carries and none
 * of them draws a pixel.
 *
 * ## A clipping attachment is skipped as a piece and applied as a mask
 *
 * It draws nothing, and it removes what every slot from its own through its
 * `end` slot draws outside its polygon. Skipping it outright drew those pixels —
 * measured on a port whose eye masks clip the irises: the blink frame read MAE
 * 1.07 against 0.53 at an open eye, with both irises drawn over closed lids,
 * where spine-webgl reads 0.16 (issue #844). So spine-core's own
 * `SkeletonClipping` runs beside the walk, and the call sequence is
 * spine-webgl's `SkeletonRenderer.draw` (branch `4.3`) step for step: at a
 * clipping attachment `clipEnd(slot)` then `clipStart(skeleton, slot, clip)` and
 * nothing drawn; at every other slot, drawn or not, `clipEnd(slot)` after it,
 * which is what ends a clip AT its end slot rather than before it; `clipEnd()`
 * after the walk. The polygon, its convex decomposition, `inverse` and `convex`
 * are the clipper's, so there is no second opinion about any of them here.
 *
 * A slot inside a clip hands its world vertices, its triangles — a region's are
 * the runtime's own `0 1 2 2 3 0` — and its UVs to `clipTrianglesUnpacked`, and
 * the piece carries what comes back. ⚠️ **Only when the clipper says it clipped**,
 * exactly as spine-webgl uses the result only when `clipTriangles` returns
 * true: an attachment wholly inside the polygon draws its own geometry, so a
 * region there is still a `Quad` and its pixels are the unclipped ones to the

 *
 * ⭐ A cut piece's pixels are sampled at each drawn triangle's SOURCE triangle's
 * affine UV (`Mesh.source`), not at its own float32 corner UVs (issue #964):
 * which convex pieces a clipper cuts a concave polygon into is the clipper's —
 * spine-core's, the core's, or spine-core's under another spelling of the same
 * polygon — and only this keeps the picture from depending on it. Measured: the
 * same notched square spelled from four start vertices moved up to 18 pixels one
 * level against itself through spine-core before, 0 after; the 19 tree rows'
 * renders did not move (spineboy-pro's portal, the one clipped row, included).
 * An unclipped piece carries no `source` and is rasterised as before, byte for
 * byte.
 *
 * The clip is applied whatever `slots`/`hidden` draw: a hidden clip still masks
 * what is shown, so a subset frame is the whole frame's pixels for those slots.
 * `unclipped` turns it off for the framing box alone — see its note.

/**
 * One piece's UVs in the drawing's own space, for the region it resolved to.
 *
 * ## The two shapes, and why only one needs arithmetic
 *
 * A **mesh** already carries them. `MeshAttachment.regionUVs` are read by
 * `spine-core` as coordinates over the *untrimmed* drawing — that is what its own
 * `u -= region.offsetX / textureWidth` and `width = region.originalWidth /
 * textureWidth` mean — so a mesh's authored UVs are atlas-independent by
 * construction, and so is its geometry: `MeshAttachment.computeWorldVertices`
 * reads `vertices` and bones and never touches the region at all. A mesh
 * therefore has nothing an atlas swap could move except its texels.
 *
 * A **region** is the case issue #199 is about. Its quad is derived from the
 * region rectangle — `RegionAttachment.computeUVs` insets it by `offsetX/offsetY`
 * and sizes it by `region.width/height` over `originalWidth/originalHeight` — so
 * swapping the atlas re-seats the quad as well as the texels. Its four corners
 * span the sub-rectangle of the drawing its own atlas kept, in `spine-core`'s
 * corner order (left-bottom, left-top, right-top, right-bottom, read straight off
 * that function's `uvs` assignments).
 *
 * ⚠️ `null` for a region whose own atlas packs it **rotated**: the corner order
 * above is the unrotated one, and `RegionAttachment.computeUVs` assigns a
 * different one at 90°. rigc emits one unrotated part per page and never packs, so
 * no candidate this ships for reaches that branch; a refusal that names itself is
 * better than a fourth opinion about a mapping only three callers have.
