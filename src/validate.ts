 * two layers:
 *
 *   A. Round-trip through the REAL spine-core. If TextureAtlas or SkeletonJson
 *      throws, the artifact is dead on arrival — those are the two failures the
 *      parser does report.
 *   B. Assertions we make ourselves, because the parser will not. Every silent

 * directions: loosen it and a caller who did not ask gets a weaker gate than the
 * one they think they ran; tighten it and foreign data is refused by a policy the
 * caller has no stake in. Issue #221 flipped the CLI to `spine` while several

/**
 * 🚨 **What `apply` does with `add`, posed rather than read off a flag.**
 *
 * `Timeline.additive` is the runtime's own declaration that a class "supports
 * being applied additively", and for two classes it is not what the class does:
 * `PathConstraintMixTimeline` and `SliderTimeline` declare `false` and pass the
 * `add` argument straight through anyway. A40 read the flag, so it refused two
 * correct rigs with a sentence about the runtime the runtime does not perform
 * (issue #655, measured by `PS143` over all thirty spellings of the motion
 * vocabulary).
 *
 * So the answer is taken from the object instead. The timeline is applied with
 * exactly the arguments `Slider.update` passes — `firedEvents` null, `alpha` 1,
 * `MixFrom.current`, `appliedPose` true — **twice**, at every time its own
 * frames name. A second application that moves the pose again is a class that
 * honours `add`; one that lands on the same value is a class that writes
 * outright; one that never moves the pose at all writes nothing a second slider
 * could erase, which is what an events timeline under a slider *is*.
 *
 * ⛔ Rejected: reading the source of `apply` (not a measurement of anything, and
 * a class whose body changes under a runtime bump would still read the old
 * answer), and a table of the two disagreeing classes written here (the same
 * hand-kept list this repository has a judgment about — it would have been
 * written after the census found two and been wrong at the third).
 *
 * ⚠️ **The skeleton wears every skin in turn, and that is not thoroughness.**
 * `Skeleton.updateCache` leaves a `skinRequired` constraint inactive under the
 * skins that do not list it, and an inactive target makes ANY timeline read
 * `inert` — a fact about that skin, not about the class. Reading one skin would
 * put a whole class in the third state and quietly stop refusing pairs that
 * share it, which is this repository's worst failure shape: a gate that looks
 * kept while checking nothing. The strongest verdict any skin produces wins.

  // 🚨 Both traps are about a page BLOCK, and an atlas can honestly have none

  // a hit-box skeleton carrying only a `boundingbox`, a clipping polygon, a
  // path — measures no pages, and `writeAtlasText` now spells that as the empty
  // file. Before this skip existed the walk below read it as one malformed page
  // block and printed two findings whose SUBJECTS DO NOT EXIST: there are no
  // consecutive blank lines in a file with no lines, and no last page block to
  // declare a region. `''.split('\n')` is `['']` rather than `[]`, so a
  // zero-byte atlas and a one-newline atlas both arrived here as a single blank
  // line, and the compiler's own output was refused by name for a shape nobody
  // had written.

  // skeleton names no attachment that resolves through one". The protection is
  // not lost, because the case where an empty atlas MATTERS is an attachment
  // that wanted a region, and that is A08's failure by name (measured: a spec

  // --- A08: every attachment path resolves to a region the atlas has -------
  //
  // 🚨 This runs on the RAW file, before the round trip, and that placement is
  // the whole of issue #589. Two of the three clauses below used to sit behind
  // A00 and could not be reached by any input: `lookup` was the path spine-core
  // had already resolved, and `AtlasAttachmentLoader.findRegion`
  // (`dist/AtlasAttachmentLoader.js:55-59`) throws
  // `Region not found in atlas: <path> (attachment: <name>)` for a path naming
  // no region and for one padded with whitespace alike, so the skeleton never
  // finished loading and A08's body never ran. Measured on three weakenings of
  // `examples/spineboy` × both profiles: every one printed A00 FAIL and A08
  // SKIP. An assertion that names the defect only when the defect is absent is
  // the silence this tool exists to convert.
  //
  // ⇒ The join is re-derived here from the raw JSON, where it is visible before
  // the loader is asked, so the miss is refused by its own sentence naming the
  // attachment, the placeholder and the path as THREE THINGS. The loader's
  // message names none of them: `(attachment: crosshair)` is the attachment's
  // `name`, never the placeholder or the skin, it never says which of the two
  // files moved, and for a padded path it prints the string unquoted —
  // `Region not found in atlas:  crosshair  (attachment: crosshair)` — where the
  // defect is literally invisible. `JSON.stringify` below is why A08 can show it.
  //
  // 🔒 The round trip is NOT suppressed by any of this, and that is deliberate:
  // it is the oracle, and gating it on rigc's own re-derivation would mean a
  // wrong join here could silence the parser rigc did not write. Because it
  // still runs, the two are a permanent two-sided cross-check — A08 refusing a
  // path A00 then loads, or A00 throwing `Region not found` over a green A08,
  // is a visible contradiction in one report. What A00 does instead of throwing
  // twice about one fact is defer: see its own body.
  //
  // 🗑️ A08 used to be MIXED: the join is validity, and a second clause gated on
  // `spine-html` required the skin entry's PLACEHOLDER to be spelled exactly
  // like the region it resolves to ("v0 requires them identical"). That clause
  // is retired (issue #574), and the reason is that the renderer it was profiled
  // under never performed the join it described.
  //
  // `spine-html@0.4.1` resolves art in two steps and the placeholder is in
  // neither. `DomTexture.js:78,102` builds the image map with
  // `put(atlasRegion.name, …)` over every region of the atlas, and
  // `SpineHtmlRenderer.js:172` reads it back as
  // `const regionImage = region && this.regionImages.get(region.name)`, where
  // `region` came off the attachment — which `AtlasAttachmentLoader` resolved
  // through `path`. Every published version of that renderer keys the same way
  // (checked 0.1.0 through 0.4.1, the whole series). Nothing in it reads an
  // attachment's name, let alone its placeholder.
  //
  // ⚠️ It was not merely inert, either: it refused rigs on both sides of the
  // convention it was written for. `path` exists precisely so a placeholder
  // may differ from the PNG basename (R5), and since issue #567 a placeholder
  // two named skins share is emitted as `<skin>/<placeholder>` with `path`
  // restated to the basename — the only spelling the Spine editor holds. Under
  // the old clause that shape, and any rig that merely named a part something
  // other than its placeholder, was red under `spine-html` while the editor
  // imported it and the renderer drew it.

  // two assertions that do so for a reason other than "the parser is happy
  // about it" — A08 because the loader refuses the file before it can name what
  // is wrong with it, this one because the loader does not come back. A draw-order
  // key whose offsets are not in ascending slot order does not load wrong — it
  // does not load at all. `readDrawOrder` (SkeletonJson.ts:1336-1374) walks a
  // forward-only cursor:
  //
  //   while (originalIndex !== index) unchanged[unchangedIndex++] = originalIndex++;
  //
  // and an entry naming an EARLIER slot than the one before it makes that
  // condition unreachable, so the loader spins and grows an array until the
  // process dies. So the check has to happen first, and when it finds that shape
  // the round trip is not attempted at all — reported as such, not as a pass.
  //
  // The other two shapes are the format's usual silence. An offset that puts a
  // slot outside the array writes past the end, leaves a −1 hole in the
  // permutation, and the fill loop reads `unchanged[-1]` — `undefined` where a

  // --- A32: every event key fires a declared event, in order ----------------

  // The event timeline's three failure modes, and only the first is loud:
  //
  //   1. **An undeclared name.** `findEvent` returns null and `readAnimation`
  //      throws `Event not found` (SkeletonJson.ts:1244). A00 would catch it, but
  //      as a parser message about a name with no context; this one says which
  //      animation, which key, and what the skeleton does declare.
  //   2. **Times out of order.** `readAnimation` writes frame `i` from key `i` in
  //      ARRAY order and never sorts, so a decreasing time builds an
  //      `EventTimeline` whose frames run backwards. It loads clean, and the
  //      firings behind the fold simply never come out. Equal times are fine —
  //      two events on one frame is ordinary — so this is non-decreasing.
  //   3. **`volume`/`balance` on a silent event.** `:1254-1257` reads them only
  //      inside `if (event.data.audioPath)`, so on an event with no `audio` they
  //      are two numbers in the file that no runtime will ever read.
  //
  // It runs on the raw JSON rather than on the loaded data because the loaded
  // `Event` no longer remembers which fields the file wrote: an override that was
  // dropped and an override that matched the default are the same object.
  //
  // ✂️ Split per clause since issue #1025 (cut 4c-4): the third mode is the
  // rig's — a readable model document states a key's `volume` and the event's
  // `audio` — and its clause is the body's (`./assertions/bodies/a32.ts`); the
  // first two, with "no string name" and "a time that is not a finite number",
  // are states the document's reader refuses by name, so they stay here, in

  // per constraint (`animations.<a>.ik.<name>` is the key array itself); `path`,
  // `physics` and `slider` put named timelines under the constraint
  // (`animations.<a>.path.<name>.position`). Both
  // shapes resolve the constraint by name AND by type —
  // `findConstraint(name, IkConstraintData)` returns null for a transform
  // constraint that happens to share the name, and `readAnimation` then throws
  // `IK Constraint not found`. That one is loud — A00 reports it, as a parser
  // message about a name with no context — so this assertion exists for the
  // second failure, which is silent:
  //
  //   **An empty key array.** `let keyMap = constraintMap[0]; if (!keyMap)
  //   continue;` — the group is read, the timeline is skipped, and nothing is
  //   said. `"ik": { "leg-ik": [] }` is a timeline that does not exist, written
  //   by a generator that thought it wrote one. Every one of the five groups has
  //   that line.
  //
  // Reporting both from here also means a candidate with a misspelled constraint
  // gets told which constraints it does have, rather than being handed the
  // loader's own sentence.
  //
  // ⚠️ `physics` was NOT in the named-timeline loop until issue #593, and the
  // comment above it named the shape after the group it left out. It cost
  // nothing while the motion spec could state two physics timelines and both
  // came from `compileValueTrack`; a spec that can state six more is a spec
  // that can aim them at a constraint that is not there. The group list is a
  // constant now, and the message that names the timelines a group takes reads

  // --- A35: a deform key's run lands inside the attachment it edits ---------
  //
  // 🚨 The nastiest silent failure in the animation half of this format. A deform
  // key is a sparse edit of a vertex array whose length comes from the attachment,
  // and the parser applies it with
  //
  //   Utils.arrayCopy(verticesValue, 0, deform, start, verticesValue.length)
  //
  // into a `Float32Array`. Writing past the end of a typed array in JavaScript is
  // a **no-op** — no throw, no warning, no NaN — so a run one pair too long, or a
  // run aimed at an attachment with fewer vertices than the author thought, loses
  // its tail and deforms the rest correctly. The result looks nearly right, which
  // is worse than looking wrong.
  //
  // One more shape, equally quiet: a **non-finite value** in `vertices` reaches
  // `computeWorldVertices` and turns the vertex into NaN, which A10 would only
  // catch if the deformed slot's BONE went non-finite, and it does not.
  //
  // The length depends on the encoding and the two are the same split
  // `readVertices` makes: unweighted is one pair per vertex, weighted is one pair
  // per bone influence (`vertices.length / 3 * 2`). Deriving it here rather than
  // assuming either is the whole point — assuming would produce a confident,
  // wrong bound on half the meshes in the world.
  //
  // ## ⛔ What this rule must NOT require: pair alignment (issue #262)
  //
  // It used to refuse an odd `offset` and an odd-length run, on the reading that
  // "the array is x, y pairs, so a run has to start and end on one". The array is
  // pairs; the RUN is not, and the parser above is the whole argument — `start` is
  // a raw index into the deform array, `arrayCopy` copies `verticesValue.length`
  // floats from it, and the element-wise `deform[i] += vertices[i]` that follows
  // walks the entire array rather than the run. There is no pair arithmetic
  // anywhere in that path, so a run may begin and end mid-pair, and every slot the
  // run does not cover keeps the zero the fresh `Float32Array` came with — which
  // is the identity delta, i.e. exactly the setup vertex.
  //
  // 🚨 That made the rule refuse legitimate editor output. Spine trims leading
  // zeros off a delta run, and a trim lands wherever the zeros stop: the official
  // `spineboy-pro` export keys `hoverboard-board` (an unweighted mesh, 148 floats)
  // with `offset: 1` and 147 values, covering `1..148`. A35 was the only assertion
  // that failed it — `A00` round-trips it and `A10` steps it clean — and it is a
  // `'validity'` rule, so it fired in every profile and told an agent holding a
  // file that every Spine runtime plays to go and change correct data.
  //
  // ⭐ The bound that survives is the one the runtime actually has: the run has to
  // FIT (`offset + vertices.length <= deformLength`). That is the quiet defect the
  // rule exists for and it is unaffected by where the run starts.

    // --- A39: a deform key that turns a triangle inside out ------------------

    // 🚨 The animation half of this format had NO geometric measurement at all.
    // `A35` measures a deform run's LENGTH and its finiteness, and is silent on
    // whether the numbers in it mean anything: a key whose offsets are the wrong
    // sign, the wrong magnitude, or geometrically degenerate is green. Issue
    // #296 is that asymmetry, measured — three builds of `gallery/portrait`, one
    // correct, one with a band inverted and one folded at 40°, gate green with
    // the same 26 PASS / 13 SKIP and a byte-identical `MESH` coverage line,
    // because that line reports the SETUP pose (docs/FACE.md §9.2).
    //
    // What this measures is the one deformed-geometry fault that has a
    // reference-free answer: a triangle whose winding REVERSES draws its texture
    // backwards, and a mesh with one in it has locally turned inside out.
    //
    // ## The frame, and why it is the posed one
    //
    // Both sides of the comparison are taken at the key's OWN time, with the
    // animation applied — the deformed mesh against the same posed bones with
    // the deform cleared. Holding the bones at SETUP instead was tried and is
    // wrong in principle: a weighted mesh's offsets are authored in bone space
    // against the pose they land in, so setup bones measure a pose that never
    // occurs. (Measured, on this corpus the two frames agree to ~0.001 px² —
    // the fold is in the deform data either way — but the principle decides it,
    // not the agreement.) Sharing the bones between the two sides is also what
    // makes a MIRRORED slot bone a non-event: a negative determinant flips every
    // triangle on both sides and cancels.
    //
    // 🚨 **And "applied" means applied the way the animation is reached** (issue
    // #407). An animation a slider applies is never played on a track — the dial
    // selects the time, so the key's time and the applied time are the same
    // number by construction — and posing it on a track while its own slider
    // applies it at the neutral is the same error as setup bones, one level up:
    // a frame no playthrough contains. It reported a fold on a correct rig, and
    // the slot-colour half of the neutral apply undid the very alpha-0 key the
    // exemption below reads. So the survey inverts the slider's own mapping and
    // drives its bone until the runtime selects this key's time; the frame it
    // used is on every `DEFORM` line and on the stats line here.
    //
    // ## ⚠️ Why this is `archetype` and not `validity`
    //
    // Because the issue's premise — "it has no legitimate counter-example" — is
    // false on this repository's own corpus, and that was found by running it:
    //
    //   - `spineboy-pro`, an official Spine editor export, flips 1 of the 101
    //     triangles of `hoverboard-board` at key 1 (area −31.53 → +8.48, 2.5e-3
    //     of that mesh's largest triangle).
    //   - `gallery/flex` flipped up to 7 of the 75 triangles of its `leaf`, and
    //     that one WAS a defect — visible tearing at the gust peak. Repaired in
    //     issue #313: its exemption is gone and it gates green here now, which
    //     leaves the editor export as the only standing counter-example.
    //
    // A `validity` rule would therefore tell an author holding correct editor
    // output to go and change it, which is what issues #44 and #262 already
    // cost this file twice. `archetype` says what is true: *rigc's own
    // formations do not fold*, judged under the profile where rigc's own policy
    // lives, and never on a skeleton rigc did not compile.
    //
    // A magnitude threshold was considered as the way to keep it `validity` —
    // exempt spineboy's 2.5e-3 sliver, catch the rest — and declined: the
    // smallest genuine defect the corpus then held (`flex` at 5.4e-3) and that
    // sliver were within a factor of two, so the wall would have been calibrated
    // on two points and separated nothing. Repairing `flex` does not revive the
    // idea: it removes the only point that was on the other side of the wall.
    // `invariants.deformMayFold` is the escape hatch instead, because *the
    // author* knows whether the page is turning over — and as of #313 nothing in
    // this repository uses it.
    //
    // ## The keys it reads no winding off at all (issue #401)
    //
    // One whose slot draws **no pixels** at that key's own time: faded to alpha
    // exactly 0, or showing another attachment. The message below states the
    // harm as "draws its texture backwards there", and that sentence is false
    // when nothing of the mesh lands — so the key is measured, printed, counted
    // on the stats line and then passed over. A triangle that draws no pixels
    // cannot draw them backwards.
    //
    // 🚨 **Exactly 0, and per key.** At alpha 0.5 a reversed triangle is plainly
    // visible at half strength and this goes on refusing it, with the alpha in
    // the message; any floor above 0 would be this repository choosing a
    // visibility policy, which is the thing an archetype rule exists not to do.
    // And a slot keyed to 0 in ONE animation is still gated in every other,
    // because the measurement is of a time and not of a slot — which is the
    // whole difference between this and `deformMayFold`, and why widening that
    // field was the wrong fix: it would have bought the fade at the price of a
    // blind spot at every angle where the part is fully visible.
    //
    // ## And the times NO key lands on (issue #403)
    //
    // The keys are where the data is; they are not where the runtime is. A deform
    // inside its fold angle at every key can be past it in between, and the
    // exemption above makes that easy to build into rather than merely possible:
    // land the alpha-0 key ON the folding key and the frames just before it are
    // drawn, nearly folded and — until this — unmeasured. Measured on the turn
    // probe: eight reversed triangles at alpha 0.20, gating green.
    //
    // So the survey also scans every SPAN between two consecutive keys. Its
    // arithmetic is a closed form rather than a subdivision count (the derivation
    // is on `wrongSignFractions`), and what it names is then *measured* at that
    // real posed time, alpha included — so a span refusal below is the same
    // measurement as a key refusal, taken at a time no key lands on.
    //
    // ⭐ **A span refusal is suppressed when either of its own two keys is
    // already refused.** The span check exists to say what the keys cannot; when
    // a key has already said it, a second and third message about one defect is
    // noise, and the build is refused either way.
    //
    // ## Where the arithmetic lives
    //
    // In [`src/deformmeasure.ts`](src/deformmeasure.ts), not here — because issue
    // #316's `DEFORM` report block prints the same reversal count this assertion
    // refuses on, and two derivations of one number drift. The survey measures
    // every key of every timeline and every span between them; this reads the
    // reversals out of it and the report prints the rest. What stays here is the
    // SEVERITY and the exemption: the survey has no opinion about either, which
    // is what lets a report run it with no exemption at all.
    //
    // Since issue #1025 (cut 4c-3) "here" is `./assertions/bodies/a39.ts`, which
    // takes the survey as a fact: `spineDeformSurvey` hands it spine-core's, and

    // are silently dead, the rig builds, and every other assertion is green.
    //
    // ## ⚠️ Why this is `validity`
    //
    // Because the claim is Spine's own arithmetic and not this project's taste:
    // a skeleton shaped this way is wrong for every runtime that plays it, so a
    // `renderer` or `archetype` kind would exclude the rule from `--profile
    // spine` — the CLI default — and the rig the issue is about would build
    // green for exactly the stranger it was written for.
    //
    // The counter-question is the one issues #44 and #262 cost this file twice:
    // can correct editor output trip it? Three shapes could, and each is
    // excluded STRUCTURALLY rather than by a threshold:
    //
    //   1. **Authority below 1.** At `mix < 1` the apply is a lerp from the
    //      current pose (`current + (value + setup - current) * alpha`), so the
    //      earlier slider still contributes and a chain of partial mixes is a
    //      legitimate — if order-dependent — weighting. A slider whose setup mix
    //      is under 1, or whose `mix` any animation keys, is dropped before the
    //      comparison. This assertion has no opinion below full authority.
    //   2. **A skin switch.** `Skeleton.updateCache` makes a `skinRequired`
    //      constraint active only while `skin.constraints.includes(data)`, and a
    //      skeleton wears one skin, so two sliders listed by disjoint skins can
    //      never be active in the same frame and cannot erase each other.
    //   3. **Different properties.** The unit compared is spine-core's own
    //      `Timeline.propertyIds`, so two sliders on one bone that key different
    //      properties — a yaw that rotates and a lift that translates — are not
    //      a finding, and a partial overlap is refused only on the properties
    //      that actually overlap.
    //
    // What is left is not a judgement call. At full authority, with both sliders
    // active, there is no value of the erased slider's dial at which it changes
    // that property: it is dead weight on every frame. That is also why this
    // rule has no `invariants` escape hatch where A39 needs one — there is
    // nothing an author could be preserving.
    //
    // ⚠️ Unmeasured, and stated as such: no editor export in this repository
    // carries a slider AT ALL — it is 4.3's newest constraint — so unlike A39
    // the "correct editor output" question rests on the runtime's arithmetic
    // rather than on a counter-example anybody has held. If an export ever
    // trips it, this paragraph is the one to reread.
    //
    // ## The second clause: `additive: true` is not always available
    //
    // A slot colour, an attachment swap, a draw order, an ik mix and a path's
    // spacing IGNORE the `add` argument entirely (`RGBATimeline.apply1` takes it
    // and never reads it), so two sliders sharing one of those overwrite each
    // other whatever the flags say. Refusing that case too is what keeps this
    // message from teaching a fix that does not work: an author told to set
    // `additive: true` on a shared rgba would get a green gate over the same
    // dead axis.
    //
    // 🚨 **Which class is which is MEASURED, and reading the flag was wrong.**
    // This clause used to ask `Timeline.additive`, the runtime's own declaration
    // that a class supports additive application — and two classes declare
    // `false` and honour `add` anyway. `PathConstraintMixTimeline` and
    // `SliderTimeline` pass the argument straight through, so two additive
    // sliders keying one path constraint's `mix`, or one bone-less slider's
    // `time`, **do** compose as the plain sum, and this assertion refused them
    // by name with a sentence about the runtime the runtime does not perform
    // (issue #655; `PS143` poses all thirty spellings of the motion vocabulary
    // and `PS140` holds the `time` case to a grid). `timelineAddBehaviour`
    // above poses each shared timeline instead, so what is compared is what the
    // class does rather than what it says about itself.
    //
    // ## The events clause, removed rather than narrowed
    //
    // The same reading refused two sliders whose animations both fire events,
    // and that refusal was over a property no pose can distinguish: `Slider`
    // applies its animation with `firedEvents` **null**
    // (`Slider.js`: `animation.apply(skeleton, p.time, p.time, data.loop, null,
    // …)`), and `EventTimeline.apply` opens with `if (!firedEvents) return`, so
    // a slider fires no event at all. Neither slider has anything on that
    // property for the other to erase. The same is true of a physics `reset`
    // under a slider, where `lastTime === time` leaves its window empty.
    //
    // ⭐ Neither is named here, and that is the point: the probe's third state
    // is **a timeline that writes nothing at all**, so both fall out of one
    // measurement instead of two exceptions. A list of unobservable spellings
    // written into this file would have been the hand-kept table that produced
    // the defect above.

    //
    // 🚨 The hole A40 leaves, and it leaves it BY CONSTRUCTION. A40's population
    // is the sliders at full authority whose own `mix` nothing keys, so the one
    // pair this rule is about — a slider whose `mix` IS keyed — is excluded
    // before any timeline is looked at. Between them the two rules ask different
    // questions about the same array: A40 asks who writes a shared property
    // last, this asks whether anybody reads what was written at all.
    //
    // `Skeleton.updateCache` walks `constraints` in order and each constraint's
    // `sort` pushes itself onto the update cache as it is reached — `sortBone`
    // pushes bones and never a constraint — so the array IS the update order,
    // for every kind. Every constraint then opens its `update` by reading its
    // own applied pose: `Slider.update` takes `mix` and `time` off it before
    // applying its animation, `PhysicsConstraint.update` returns on `mix === 0`
    // before reading `inertia`, `wind` and the rest, and the ik, transform and
    // path constraints read their mixes the same way. So a slider that keys any
    // property of a constraint is read by that constraint only when it comes
    // LATER in the array; written the other way round the value lands in a pose
    // whose only reader has already run, and `Skeleton.updateWorldTransform`
    // opens the next frame by putting `Posed.resetConstrained` over it.
    //
    // [measured, issue #665] One dial and one constraint, in both array orders,
    // read at 6 positions of the dial. The constraint's own pose holds the same
    // ramp in BOTH orders — the write happens either way — and what the
    // constraint drives is dead in one of them:
    //
    //   ik         shin worldY   0.000e+0 against 1.662e+1 the other way round
    //   transform  shin world x-angle 0.000e+0 against 4.000e+1
    //   path       rider worldX  0.000e+0 against 1.620e+2
    //   physics    tip worldX    0.000e+0 against 4.256e+2, over 30 frames, so

    // ⭐ The runtime repairs this for BONES and not for constraints, which is
    // why an author cannot reason it out from the bone case. `Slider.sort`
    // clears `sorted` on every bone its animation keys and re-sorts them, so

    // a slider muted at setup that keys its own `mix` up reports green and is
    // dead forever — `update` returns on `mix === 0` before the animation that
    // would raise it is ever applied. Only a slider can reach that shape: the
    // constraint at the driver's own index IS the driver.
    //
    // ⚠️ `physics` `reset` is NOT in this population, and the measurement is why
    // the card that asked for "every constraint a slider's animation keys" is
    // refused here on one spelling. `PhysicsConstraintResetTimeline` writes no

    // printed this rule as SKIP and the run green under both profiles, and
    // `render` refused the same file by the bone. A static rig's setup pose
    // is the whole of what it shows, so that was the one pose nothing read.

    // Normal-mode pose to the last digit while the file says `noScale`. The
    // world position stays finite, so the loop below never saw it (#733).

    // ⚠️ Posed AT each key rather than read off the stepping loop, because a
    // stepped value lives from its key to the next one and a sampling grid
    // can step over a short span entirely. What is judged is whether the
    // posed value IS a mode — which is this assertion's name exactly — and

    // is the mode written by construction of the same lookup, so an equality
    // here would be the parser agreeing with itself.
    //
    // -- the whole world transform, at the setup pose and every stepped frame
    //
    // 🚨 Read through `firstNonFinite` (`./nonfinite.ts`) over `posedNumbersOf`,
    // the scan `render` refuses on, and not a second opinion of it (issue #882). This loop read `worldX` and
    // `worldY` alone until then, and a bone at `rotation: 1e309` — in its setup
    // pose or as a `rotate` key — poses a finite position over a NaN `a`, `b`,
    // `c` and `d` whenever it has no child offset from it: measured on every
    // leaf bone of the three generated probes, 20 of 20 green through the whole
    // gate, and `render` then refused the same file by the bone. So the gate
    // said the skeleton was fine and the renderer said it was not, which is two
    // definitions of one word. The scan reads the six terms of every bone, then
    // the vertices of every region and mesh shown — because a bone can be
    // finite over a vertex that is not (a `scaleX` chain whose product stays
    // under the largest double while every corner of the child's region
    // passes it) — and names the bone or the vertex, the term and the frame.
    //
    // ⚠️ The setup pose is its own surface and is read as such: every frame
    // below is posed AFTER `state.apply`, so a bone the animation keys from

    // the rig at rest does show it.
    //
    // 🔸 Posed once, before any animation is set, rather than once per
    // animation as it was until #902: `setAnimation` does not touch the

    // applies to an assertion's name: it may not say less than what it decides.
    //
    // 🚨 **And the subject is real silence, measured rather than supposed.** Three
    // shapes load with no complaint:
    //
    //   1. A `dark` the parser drops. `SkeletonJson` reads `getValue(slotMap,
    //      "dark", null)` and then `if (dark)`, so `""` is discarded without a
    //      word and the slot renders as though the field had never been written.

    //      `"4020"` loads `b = NaN` — a colour that is neither the author's nor
    //      an error.
    //   3. An `rgba2` (or, since issue #730, `rgb2`) timeline on a slot with no
    //      `dark` at all. `Slot`'s

  // different camera angle — and sibling variants of ONE cut can differ by tens
  // of degrees. Put the direction in the axis bone's setup rotation instead and
  // the keys become translateX along it, reusable across every variant. A
  // screen-space y component on any bone in that subtree therefore means
  // somebody has put the direction back into the keys.
  //
  // The axis bone itself must carry no keys at all: `invariants.axisBone` names
  // a per-cut SETUP value, and animating it swings the whole formation.

  // ⚠️ Some bones are detached ON PURPOSE. An emitter that releases something
  // into the world must not ride the part that released it, or what it emits
  // gets dragged along with every stroke instead of staying where it left and
  // taking gravity. The rig states each such pair in `invariants.detached`, with

  // adjacency in that array — and nothing in the file objects to the wrong

  // both directions: nothing out of order, and nothing missing.
  //
  // ⚠️ The second half is new with issue #575 and the first half is why it had
  // to be. This clause used to accept any SUBSEQUENCE of the table, because the
  // compiler dropped a slot no skin filled and the gate was written around that
  // — so the defect #575 filed was licensed by the assertion that was supposed
  // to catch it: two production exports declaring 53 and 61 slots built green
  // at 51 and 57. `compile` now emits every declared slot, empty if nothing

  // --- A29: inward travel stops where the two masses meet ------------------

  // plates (`tools/measure_contact_depth.ts`) and recorded in the manifest as
  // `stroke.contact_depth`, so the ceiling is a fact about the art rather than a
  // number somebody picked. Drive past it and the frame renders two bodies
  // interpenetrating — and NOTHING in skeleton JSON objects: the animation loads,
  // plays, and is simply wrong. Exactly the shape of silent wrongness this
  // validator exists for.
  //
  // Two things spend the same clearance and so are added together:
  //   * the travel itself, a translateX on a bone in the axis subtree (A24
  //     guarantees there is no hidden screen-space component to miss); and
  //   * the mass bone's own inward keys. `invariants.massBone` typically hangs
  //     outside the axis subtree, so its keys are screen-space by design — they
  //     get projected onto the axis rather than read as axis coordinates.
  //     Ignoring them would let a rig pass while a recoil key closed the last few
  //     pixels of the gap.

  // 🎯 The second ceiling, and it is NOT a restatement of A29. Contact asks when
  // two masses collide; containment asks when the moving part's leading contour
  // stops being covered by the occluder's opaque footprint. Past that point the
  // part is drawn in a place the art says is hidden — and like every failure in
  // this family it is completely silent: the animation loads, plays, and shows
  // one plate passing through another.
  //
  // A cut can have either ceiling without the other, which is why they are two
  // manifest fields and two assertions. Two plates cut from ONE piece of art are
  // adjacent at rest and never "meet", so that cut has no contact ceiling at all
  // and only a containment one.
  //
  // ⚠️ Second half, and it is what keeps the first half true: the ceiling is
  // measured on the UNDEFORMED contour, by translating the plate along the axis.
  // A scale key on any bone in the axis subtree changes the contour itself, so the
  // measured number stops describing the rig — quietly, because the file still
  // validates. Rather than assert a number that no longer means anything, refuse

/**
 * Every value a skeleton file carries, as the **parser** understands it.
 *
 * ## Why this is here and not in `diff.ts`
 *
 * `diff` compares structure over raw JSON and says so in its own header:
 * *"Pure JSON reading — no spine-core, no filesystem."* Comparing the values
 * inside that structure needs the format's per-field defaults — `time` absent
 * is 0, `scaleX` absent is 1, a physics key's `value` absent is 0 but its `mix`
 * is 1 — and a second spelling of those inside the gate is exactly what this
 * repository refuses (CLAUDE.md, *The compiler never invents a value*). So the
 * defaults are taken from the one reader that owns them, which means the
 * runtime, which means this file: `CLAUDE.md`'s *Conventions* names the three
 * modules allowed to link spine-core and `src/validate.ts` is the one that
 * "owns the round trip". `src/bonedist.ts` is the precedent for the other half
 * — an instrument that needs the runtime and reaches it through `render.ts`
 * rather than linking it itself. `diff.ts` compares what this returns.
 *
 * ## What it covers
 *
 * Everything on `SkeletonData` that is not on the skip list above: the header
 * and stage, every bone's setup pose and `length`, every slot's colours, blend
 * and setup attachment, every attachment in every skin (a region's offsets,
 * rotation, scale and size; a mesh's vertices, weights, `regionUVs`,
 * triangles, hull and edges; a bounding box's, path's and clipping shape's
 * vertices), every constraint's pose and flags, every event's payload, and for
 * every timeline every frame — time and values, from the runtime's own
 * `getFrameEntries()` — its curve type and Bezier samples, and its deform
 * vertices, attachment names, draw orders and event payloads.
 *
 * ## What it does not
 *
 * - **`version` and `hash`.** The rig spec has no field for either; `ingest`
 *   reports them as `HEADER_REDERIVED` and `HEADER_BOOKKEEPING` findings, and
 *   a rebuild restating the runtime rigc links is the whole reason the corpus
 *   gate is `diff` at 1.000 rather than a byte comparison (`docs/INGEST.md`
 *   §2.3). They are named here so that skipping them is a decision a reader
 *   can see rather than an omission.
 * - **Anything below one float32 step.** `spine-core` stores frames, curves and
 *   vertices in `Float32Array`, so two values that round to the same float32
 *   are equal to this walk whatever the file says. The comparison's tolerance
 *   states that bound rather than hiding it.
 * - **A Bezier's control points as such.** The parser samples them into
 *   `curves` (`setBezier`), so what is compared is the sampled curve; a moved
 *   handle moves the samples, but by a different amount than it moved the
 *   handle.
