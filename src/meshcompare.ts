/**
 * Two triangulations of one attachment compared in motion — the pose/motion
 * half of the contract in docs/MESH_REDUCTION.md (issue #1221, stage C1:
 * issue #1230).
 *
 * One operation lives here, `compareMeshesInMotion`: a reference build and one
 * or more candidate builds of the same rig — the same rig with one
 * attachment's mesh replaced (P8) — posed through rigc's own core over each
 * build's model document, every candidate compared with the reference on the
 * attachment's region UV square (§3), into one `mesh-quality-report/1`
 * document with `operation: 'compare'` (`writeMeshQualityReport` writes its
 * text; no second format).
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * A reduced mesh is fewer vertices carrying the same art. Whether it still
 * moves like the mesh it came from is a question no geometry row answers: a
 * bend needs vertices where it bends, and a mesh without them passes every
 * coverage bound at the setup pose and folds the art at the first key. So the
 * candidate and the reference are posed on one schedule, and the art they
 * carry — the same texel, named by its UV, which no deform and no repack moves
 * — is compared in world units at every frame.
 *
 * ## The comparison, as implemented
 *
 * - **Poser.** `src/core/` over the model document (`readModel`), the walk
 *   `src/render_core.ts` poses an animation with — `poseRawAnimationEach`,
 *   the reset taken at the animation (`'animation'`) — and `poseRawSetup` for
 *   the setup pose; a skin is posed as `underSkin`, no skin as `underNoSkin`
 *   (what `noSkinView` in `src/render_core.ts` is). Nothing here links
 *   spine-core (`CUR07`), and the report says which poser ran (`poser`, P2).
 * - **Equality (correction 5).** Every input of the two model documents is
 *   compared, leaf by leaf, except the allowlist `ALLOWED` states; the first
 *   difference refuses the call (`COMPARE_INPUTS_DIFFER`) naming its path and
 *   both values.
 * - **The domain (correction 4).** The centre of every art pixel of the mask
 *   at the final threshold, carried to UV as `((x + 0.5) / w, (y + 0.5) / h)`,
 *   plus every reference hull vertex's UV. Each sample is carried by the UV
 *   triangle that contains it — barycentric, each coordinate at least `−1e-9`,
 *   the predicate epsilon of `src/mesh.ts` — in the reference and in each
 *   candidate, never by vertex index. A UV triangle inside the A39 area band
 *   (`areaBand` over the UVs) carries nothing. Two carriers are one hit only
 *   when the sample lies on a vertex or an edge both share (the same vertex
 *   indices carry it in each); any other pair is `COMPARE_UV_CARRIER_NOT_UNIQUE`.
 *   A sample no triangle carries is counted and listed, never dropped silently.
 * - **The distance.** At each frame the carried point is the barycentric
 *   combination of the carrying triangle's posed world vertices — the raw
 *   pose's own doubles, weighted vertices through their bones. The row is the
 *   largest distance between the candidate's and the reference's carried point
 *   over the finite sample set and the frames, in world units. Alignment is by
 *   construction (one rig, one schedule); nothing is fitted.
 * - **Stretch and inversion.** Each candidate triangle's map from its setup
 *   world triangle to its posed one: `stretchSingularValues` (`src/areaband.ts`),
 *   and A39's rule for a reversal — the band over the setup and the posed
 *   areas, a triangle with no setup area skipped, one collapsed onto zero not
 *   reversed. A slot `invariants.deformMayFold` names is exempt from the count's
 *   bound and its folds are listed.
 * - **The reference (P8, §3 *Independent evidence*).** Each build's art fit at
 *   the setup pose is measured under its own bounds — the reference under
 *   `referenceArtFit`, each candidate under `candidateArtFit` — and a reference
 *   whose coverage, overshoot or undercut fails its bound is refused (`COMPARE_REFERENCE_FAILS`), never
 *   compared against. (b), the gate on each build, is where it runs: `build`
 *   writes the model document only after every assertion passed, and this
 *   module, handed the document's text, does not run it a second time.
 * - **Schedule (P10, P11).** Frames by `FrameRef.id`; physics reset at time 0
 *   on every walk and stepped at the declared `dt` to each frame (the oracle's
 *   `stepSchedule` rule: from the last frame, steps of `dt` while before the
 *   next, then to it), the same steps for the reference and every candidate. A
 *   nonzero `warmupSteps` is refused, never run as zero.
 *
 * ## What it never does
 *
 * - Invent a bound, a frame or a split: rows with no bound are `undeclared`,
 *   the frames are the caller's, selection membership is the caller's.
 * - Pose through spine-core, or reach the compiler.
 * - Put a time, a path or a machine in the document.
