description: Author, build and validate Spine 4.3 skeleton data (skeleton.json plus its .atlas) from loose part PNGs with rigc, the rig compiler that verifies its own output with named assertions before writing it. Use for any request to make a Spine rig or Spine animation from PNG parts, or where the source is a Live2D, Unity or video model whose pictures you can render, to run or read rigc build, validate, render, preview, check or vote, or to write or fix a *.rig.json or *.motion.json spec; it says which shipped guide to open for the need at hand. Not for Live2D conversion, cutting an illustration into parts, or real-time face tracking.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires Bun 1.2 or later. The tool is the npm package rig-c (bunx rig-c, or bun add -d rig-c); the command it installs is rigc.

# rigc — a rig compiler for agents

rigc compiles a rig spec and a motion spec into Spine 4.3 skeleton data and an
atlas, runs its named assertions — rigc's own validator in the published package,
held to a `@esotericsoftware/spine-core` round trip's verdicts in its CI, all but
the parse itself — and writes **only if every one is green**. You cannot see the
rig you are authoring. The validator's messages and the shipped guides are the
whole interface, and this skill only says which of them to open.

## Non-negotiables

- **Validation is never bypassed.** `build` writes nothing on a red gate; there is
  no `--no-validate`, and none may be added — AUTHORING §0 says so in as many
  words. Correctness is the whole of the reason: the assertions are what make the
  output trustworthy, and they are held to the official parser's verdicts in the
  repository's CI — all but the parse itself, which runs only where the runtime is
  installed and is reported as a SKIP elsewhere.
- **The compiler never invents a value.** A field the spec leaves out is a
  `CompileError` naming that field. Fill the spec; do not expect a default read off
  the art — AUTHORING §2 and §5.
- **The validator's messages are the instructions.** Each names the object, the
  value found and the value required, and AUTHORING §5 maps every named failure to
  the file that has to change.
- **A green gate cannot see a wrong animation.** If you were given pictures,
  `check` is the half of the loop that can; if not, `render` or `preview` and look —
  AUTHORING §0 and §9.

## Install

```shell
bunx rig-c --help       # run it without installing
bun add -d rig-c        # or pin it in the project; the command is `rigc`
bun rigc skills install      # then link these skills into .agents/skills
```

Codex, Gemini CLI and Antigravity read skills from `.agents/skills/` in the
workspace and none of them reads `node_modules`; `rigc skills install` puts every
skill the package ships there, and `rigc skills --help` says what it refuses.

The package links no Spine runtime. `validate`, `preview` and `vote` below run
through `@esotericsoftware/spine-core`: install it beside the package
(`bun add -d @esotericsoftware/spine-core`) and the same `rigc` runs them, and
`build` runs the round trip as well. Without it they are refused by name, and
`build` writes the same files gated without the parse — `rigc --version` names the
entry that ran. In the parse's place that `build` runs two rules of its own over
rigc's model document, `A00_MODEL_READ` and `A00_MODEL_REGIONS_ON_PAGES`; they are
not registry assertions, so its summary counts two more, and AUTHORING §5.2 has a
row for each.

## The loop

1. `rigc build --rig <spec> --motion <spec> --images <dir> --out <dir>` compiles,
   gates, and writes only on green.
2. Read the report. Every red line names the file to change; fix the spec and
   build again.
3. `rigc explain --rig <spec> --motion <spec> --out <dir>` when the red line is
   not enough — the compiled rig as a table: every bone with its resolved parent,
   the slots in draw order, every timeline key by key, and a `DEFORM` block per
   deform key. It takes no `--profile`, it never gates, and it writes nothing, so
   the figures are readable on a build the gate is refusing — AUTHORING §0 and
   §4.11.2.
4. `rigc render --candidate <out>` or `rigc preview --candidate <out>` — look at
   it. A rig with its head off its torso passes the gate; looking is what catches it.
   Open one frame at full size, not only `contact.png`: the sheet is for spacing
   across frames, and a defect is read on a frame. Ask it three things — is any
   picture drawn twice, is there a straight edge where the art has none, does a part
   cover a feature the art shows — and answer each with `render --hide <slot>` (or
   `--slot <slot,…>`), which draws the frame again without that part on the same
   grid, so the two frames say which part a pixel is. AUTHORING §0 holds the three.
5. `rigc check --candidate <out> --frames <dir>` when you have reference pictures
   (`--out <dir>` writes the picture each of its numbers came from — open the worst).
   Read its output from the top: the framing block says whether the figures under
   it are about placement or motion. A figure is where the loop starts, not where it
   ends — keep the first green build's figure, check every later build against the
   same frames, and stop when the figure stops moving, not when it exists; AUTHORING
   §9.2 says how to read the framing block and the floor to read a figure against.
   `rigc vote --candidate <a> --candidate <b>` when several candidates are green and
   only a person can choose between them.
6. `rigc validate <out>` re-gates artifacts already on disk, and
   `rigc <command> --help` is each command's own flag table. `rigc repack <out>
   --out <dir>` packs a build again under `build --pack`'s packing flags when its
   parts were not kept, and writes only after every region and the skeleton are
   shown unchanged (`--accept-skeleton-differences` writes a rebuild whose skeleton
   differs, every difference printed; `--stage-box <slot>` reads a build's stage box)
   — AUTHORING §0.4.
7. Every finished unit ends with `rigc preview --candidate <out>`, and the report
   names the `.html` it wrote. The hand-off to a person is part of the work.

The loop in full, with `pose` before it and `chainfit` after the first build:
AUTHORING §0.

## When the source is not loose PNGs

A Live2D model, a Unity scene or a video is a player, not a set of parts. Make the
reference frames first: render the source at the rate you will check at, into one
directory of `f0000.png`, `f0001.png`…, and `rigc check --frames <that dir> --fps <rate>`
reads them with no `frames.json`. A port with no reference frames is unmeasured,
not finished. The parts are the source's own texture cut along its drawables, never
a screenshot: a screenshot is the composed result, and a part cut from it carries
every part under it. Where a part goes is its drawable's geometry — its vertices in
model space, its UVs, its triangles — which is a mesh attachment with those three
(AUTHORING §3.4, *Mesh attachment*); a region at the drawable's bounding-box centre
keeps only the box. rigc reads none of those formats — FACE §11, the paragraph
that opens *No Live2D file is read or written*
([FACE.md](https://github.com/firejune/rigc/blob/main/docs/FACE.md#11-non-goals--stated-so-nobody-proposes-them-as-gaps)) —
only the pictures they produce. The rule, the background those frames need and
what a wrong one costs: AUTHORING §0, *When the source is a foreign player*.
