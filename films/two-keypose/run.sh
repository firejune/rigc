# Player, and the Andale-Mono font — macOS ships it, and it is the one mono face
# checked here that renders "→" AND leaves "--flag" as two dashes rather than an
# en dash.

#     shared inputs had simply been copied in beside this film's own; here they
#     are taken from film one's directory, so the art is referenced rather than
#     duplicated into films/. Two of the four are things film one's steps 1-2
#     WRITE, so they are made by running those two steps — neither needs film
#     one's `bun add`, both are pure bun + rsvg-convert + magick.
